So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +21.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 18.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $5.45 per share, indicating a change of +400% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +16.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +81.3%. This estimate has changed +16.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.06 indicates a change of +11% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.02 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +234%. For the current and next fiscal years, $103.49 billion and $118.77 billion estimates indicate +69.9% and +14.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $22.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +265.3%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.82%.

The EPS surprise was +13.41%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Loading...\n\nToday at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco, Ubisoft Entertainment SA UBSFF pulled back the curtain on \"NEO NPCs,\" a groundbreaking prototype showcasing the potential of generative AI (GenAI) to revolutionize player interactions with non-playable characters (NPCs) and redefine gameplay experiences.\n\nLed by a dedicated team at Ubisoft\u2019s Paris studio and backed by the company\u2019s Production Technology department, NEO NPCs represent a significant leap forward in the integration of AI within gaming environments.\n\nSee Also: Google's DeepMind Reveals AI That Plays Games Just Like Humans\n\nDescribing the initiative, Virginie Mosser, narrative director on the project, emphasized the profound impact of working on NEO NPCs: \"My creative work has become much deeper since I get to work on their (NEO NPCs) psychology. I have to give them a soul and do so with a certain finesse that we have never before allocated to NPC creation.\"\n\nIn a closed-door demonstration at GDC, Ubisoft showcased how NEO NPCs can establish connections with players through real-time, adaptive dialogue.\n\nPlayers engage in conversations with these advanced NPCs via voice-to-chat, with the NPCs dynamically adjusting their responses based on the player's intentions and emotional cues. This not only enhances immersion but also offers new avenues for emergent storytelling and gameplay strategies.\n\nXavier Manzanares, director and producer of the project, expressed optimism about the potential of NEO NPCs to redefine player-NPC interactions: \"The game world actually listens to and dynamically responds to the players. Social interactions and skills become part of the gameplay. Smarter NPCs like our NEO NPCs have the potential to become a breakthrough addition to the traditional NPCs we see in games today.\"\n\nNEO NPCs' situational awareness extends beyond dialogue, enabling them to react dynamically to points of interest within the game world. This capability opens doors to diverse roles for NPCs, ranging from quest providers to training partners and AI companions.\n\nThe development of NEO NPCs has been made possible through collaboration with leading GenAI technology partners, including Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Inworld AI.\n\nNvidia's Vice President of Developer and Performance Technologies John Spitzer added: \"AI is a powerful tool that can greatly enhance players\u2019 experiences by making games more dynamic, immersive and unique.\"\n\nGuillemette Picard, senior vice president of Production Technology at Ubisoft, underscored the transformative potential of generative AI for creators and players: \"Generative AI brings unprecedented creative opportunities for our teams and players. It is when they find the value it has for them that we start to see its true potential to transform the way games are made and played.\"\n\nUbisoft is transparent about the experimental nature of its latest creation, presenting it as a prototype.\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nWhile the company hints at advancements like \"real-time emotion and animation\" and \"contextual awareness,\" the demo fell short of expectations, according to Sean Hollister, senior editor and founding member of The Verge, who played three prototype demos at the GDC.\n\nHollister reported that although one NPC named \"Bloom\" benefits from a scripted backstory, interactions still suffer from lag and occasional stutters. However, the journalist said: \"The most important advancement was simply that Ubisoft gave me an actual reason to talk to these chatbots, with in-game objectives.\"\n\nRead Next: Survey Reveals 87% Of Game Developers Embrace Open-Source Amid AI Concerns, Layoff Fears\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Ubisoft.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3686, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0ef2af2-feb4-4314-87f3-9885d1a45f39": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0ef2af2-feb4-4314-87f3-9885d1a45f39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/102.html", "file_name": "102.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3042, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "495efc2b-1937-415f-9000-fbd6aeb74d26", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/102.html", "file_name": "102.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3042, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "c982d4dc36db3b2878e5c335f72f87fb92f1c57540243b52d7196573a24a8e3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "463cf799-e1f0-49d8-9255-76346a9fad4c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/100.html", "file_name": "100.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3692, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "589865d468dadc5131b59a5b0a7cc2dc96ef85cd511cfba4ecabbe14e7a2796a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba2db683-1dc6-4c13-9f5c-331476f51155", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e4965de5ba269af967d5484ab4916936eed2d4251407c1648e85aae7a25f206", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bc392aa57447c454ecf33b2c07044f6fde8f42e67ab93d631629a9a427a7eac6", "text": "Loading...

The collaboration will leverage Nvidia\u2019s advanced AI technology to fortify CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity solutions.\n\nWhat Happened: CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz revealed the company\u2019s partnership with Nvidia. Kurtz explained that by integrating Nvidia\u2019s AI technology, CrowdStrike can offer its clients more sophisticated and cost-effective services in an interview with CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d with Jim Cramer.\n\n\"What we're talking about with Nvidia, as a producer of massive amounts of security data, is being able to leverage their Morpheus framework to allow our customers to bring their own LLM models,\" Kurtz said. We've got the data; they've got the power and the software.\"\n\nHe highlighted the potential of Nvidia\u2019s Morpheus framework in enabling customers to utilize their own LLM (large language model) models. This partnership will allow CrowdStrike to bring custom LLM-powered applications to the enterprise, addressing novel, domain-specific use cases.\n\nKurtz compared AI to an engine and data to oil, emphasizing that CrowdStrike has abundant data, collecting trillions of data signals and threat events daily. This data is used to train mathematical models to distinguish between good and bad, with the models becoming more advanced as they are further trained.\n\nSee Also: Whopping $33.8 Million Worth Of Dogecoin Shifted To Robinhood \u2014 And People Suspect This Person Could Be Behind It\n\nHe also pointed out the increasing capabilities of cybercriminals, who have democratized attacks for the \u201ccybercrime masses,\u201d allowing unskilled attackers to access and use advanced technology.\n\n\"When you look at the chips, you know, it's all about [CEO Huang] Jensen and Nvidia, right? That's where the game is being played,\" Kurtz said. \"It's a quantum leap.\"\n\nWhy It Matters: The partnership between CrowdStrike and Nvidia comes at a time when AI-related stocks are surging ahead of Nvidia\u2019s highly anticipated GPU Technology Conference (GTC).

It's expected to hit the market sometime next year.\n\n\u201cBlackwell\u2019s not a chip, it\u2019s the name of a platform,\u201d Huang said during his speech to a packed house at the SAP Center. \"Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger [graphics-processing units].\"\n\nAnalysts see Nvidia's new Blackwell launch as putting more distance between itself and rival chipmaker AMD. TheStreet / Shutterstock\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari, who boosted his price target on Nvidia by $125 to $1,000 a share, said he came away from the speech with a \"renewed appreciation\" for Nvidia's AI ambitions.\n\nSilicon Valley's 'most ambitious project'?\n\nHari also affirmed the stock's place on the investment bank's closely tracked 'Conviction Buy' list, citing what he called a \"unique ability to innovate at data-center scale (as opposed to at the GPU or chip level)\" as well as its \"compelling position as one of the key enablers and beneficiaries of the ongoing build-out of generative AI infrastructure.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann described the Blackwell launch as \"likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed.\"\n\nOthers touted the new chips' potential to transform the broader potential for AI modeling and inference while adding further distance between Nvidia and its chipmaker rivals.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBlackwell appears likely to be strong, and the company\u2019s continued push not just on chips but on broader software and hardware ecosystems remains unmatched (and in our opinion, hard to stand against),\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who carries a buy rating with a $1,000 price target on Nvidia stock.\n\nRelated: Jensen Huang outlines a huge future for Nvidia\n\nNvidia declined, at least for the moment, to offer pricing details for the new Blackwell chips, but analysts see the potential for an average selling price around 40% higher than the current range for H100 chips, which go for between $30,000 and $40,000 each.\n\nBaird analyst Tristan Gerra said the \"very significant performance step up means Blackwell will likely trigger a strong refresh rate while making it exceedingly more difficult for ASIC architectures to compete.\"\n\n\"We hear B100 pricing will be close to 40% higher than H100, representing a key top-line catalyst for Nvidia next year,\u201d said Gerra, who carries a $1,050 price target and an overweight rating on Nvidia stock.\n\nNvidia is leaving rivals in the dust\n\nWells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers also noted that the new Blackwell GPUs will likely offer a significant performance premium to Nvidia's closest competitor, the MI300x, made by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) .

I was wrong when looking at the fundamental results, as I did not expect these extremely high growth rates the business could report. And I was wrong when looking at the stock performance in the last 1.5 years - really wrong.\n\nBut that is only part of the story and is one statement one can make. Time will have to tell if I am wrong in the long run. In the following article, I will pick up my line of reasoning I already made in my last article titled \"NVIDIA is giving me Dotcom Vibes\" - the argument that Nvidia is in a gigantic bubble.\n\nAnd since my last article, Mr. Market is clearly mocking me as the stock increased 74% in the meantime. Of course, a 74% price increase in about three months is not proof itself that the stock is in a bubble, but such a stock price movement should at least be reason enough for all of us to prick up our ears.\n\nResults\n\nLet's start by looking at the last results the business reported - and once again the Q4 results were impressive. Not only did Nvidia beat top and bottom line expectations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, revenue for the full year increased from $26,974 million in fiscal 2023 to $60,922 million in fiscal 2024 - resulting in 126% year-over-year growth. And without much discussion, more than doubling the top line within a year despite already generating $27 billion in revenue is impressive.\n\nBut even more impressive is the operating income reported for fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2024, operating income was $32,972 million and compared to an operating income of $4,224 million this is an increase of 681% year-over-year. And diluted net income per share increased 586% year-over-year from $1.74 in the previous year to $11.93 in fiscal 2024. And when looking at the quarterly results, the picture is looking even better.\n\nNVIDIA Q4/FY24 Presentation\n\nWhen looking at revenue by market platform, the statement is very simple. Almost all revenue was generated by Data Center and almost the entire growth in fiscal 2024 stemmed from this segment. Revenue from Data Center increased from $15,005 million in fiscal 2023 to $47,525 million in fiscal 2024 resulting in 217% YoY growth. By the way, in the fourth quarter, revenue for Data Center increased even 409% year-over-year to $18,404 million.\n\nMot only did Data Center revenue increase, but revenue increased from $9,067 million in fiscal 2023 to $10,447 million in fiscal 2024 - resulting in 15.2% year-over-year growth. And revenue for Professional Visualization is also up slightly, but only 1% from $1,544 million to $1,553 million.\n\nNVIDIA Q4/FY24 Presentation\n\nAnd when looking at the last eight quarters, we see the dramatic shift in revenue distribution - only two years ago Data Center was responsible for 45% of total revenue, and in the last quarter Data Center was responsible for 83% of total revenue.\n\nOwn work created with Datawrapper\n\nBubble, Dotcom, and Irrational Exuberance\n\nThese results are great, but investing is never about past results, but about future free cash flow a company can generate.

And here it is getting interesting. On the one hand, we have bullish expectations about high growth rates for the coming years. On the other hand, we had several comparisons in the last few months between the late-stage Dotcom bubble companies and Nvidia. One comparison that was made again and again (including my last article already mentioned above) - is the comparison between Nvidia and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO).\n\nFor starters, I am not a big fan of just overlapping two charts - for example, the chart of Cisco in 1999/2000 and the chart of NVIDIA today. Nevertheless, I must admit that the two charts are showing many similarities - as demonstrated by the Financial Times in several articles.\n\nFinancial Times\n\nWhen comparing stocks to the Dotcom bubble era, we should not just talk about stock prices, but the overvaluation of stocks is one of the characteristics of such a bubble and could therefore be a good starting point for a discussion.\n\nProbably one of the best books on this topic is Irrational Exuberance by Robert Shiller, where the Nobel laureate explains the contributing factors in a very compelling fashion. Usually, we have a \"new era of economic thinking\" with people expecting the future to be bright - mostly due to new technology. This was the case in the years leading up to the Dotcom bubble, and it is the case right now. Similar to Cisco or Intel (two companies hit hard following the Dotcom bubble), Nvidia is also providing the hardware for a new technology. In both cases, we also see herd behavior fueled by the media (or social media).\n\nAnd an argument we are reading quite often is that we are in a new bull market. But the opposite is true, we are in the last stages of a bull market and bubbles and irrational exuberance are symptoms of the last stage in a bull market. Investors being irrational and exuberant about a potential new and long-lasting bull market is also typical for this stage. Nvidia seems to be the poster boy for this irrational exuberance just as Cisco was the poster boy in 2000 or Cathie Wood and the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) was the poster girl for the tech bubble in 2021.\n\nIntrinsic Value Calculation\n\nUsually, we are trying to determine an intrinsic value for a stock to make a discussion if a stock can be bought or not. In this case, we are reversing the process - we are determining what amounts of free cash flow Nvidia must generate in the years to come to be fairly valued at this point.\n\nAs always, we are calculating with a 10% discount rate and the last reported number of outstanding shares - in this case 2,490 million. The basis for our calculation is the free cash flow of the last four quarters, which was $26,947 million, and for Nvidia to be fairly valued right now it must grow the free cash flow with a CAGR of 22% for the next ten years followed by 6% growth till perpetuity.\n\nNow let's look at these assumptions in more detail. But for starters, 22% growth for ten years is achievable, and there certainly are businesses that have grown at such a high pace, but these are already growth assumptions one must be cautious about making.\n\nSecond, these assumptions also imply that Nvidia is growing at a stable pace in the next ten years and that the business is able to avoid every recession as well as the typical cyclicality in the semiconductor industry.", "start_char_idx": 2656, "end_char_idx": 6479, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "424f94f4-988f-49af-aadd-c6337ec1ae8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "424f94f4-988f-49af-aadd-c6337ec1ae8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/127.html", "file_name": "127.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 15044, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02f2fa21-7232-4ae4-a76a-b212261f41c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/127.html", "file_name": "127.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 15044, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5ac51d3128d016c2caead9d60b8162c6d390defb34bdd84b770fc8e48714601e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2c61e1d-0c53-4509-bacd-ac2f47912f7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/127.html", "file_name": "127.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 15044, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "3f4fa4635ae0195e6666ba92d5a55cfadac863a21c4aff668e857d89e360ea69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "309e2df9-349d-4833-acbd-2cac824446db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66ca7661cf887ccf02d0d1c6533aeddc253431d4f477468d2f6d18965dd00904", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "15336ed2292a8070466bc72927b4353cb5b73336172efa0031f4bc5b6a9e01f0", "text": "The basis for our calculation is the free cash flow of the last four quarters, which was $26,947 million, and for Nvidia to be fairly valued right now it must grow the free cash flow with a CAGR of 22% for the next ten years followed by 6% growth till perpetuity.\n\nNow let's look at these assumptions in more detail. But for starters, 22% growth for ten years is achievable, and there certainly are businesses that have grown at such a high pace, but these are already growth assumptions one must be cautious about making.\n\nSecond, these assumptions also imply that Nvidia is growing at a stable pace in the next ten years and that the business is able to avoid every recession as well as the typical cyclicality in the semiconductor industry. And when looking at Nvidia's past, we can call such a scenario rather unlikely.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAnd not only should we talk about recessions and cyclicality. We should also talk about the risk of a new technology not playing out as expected. Let me be very clear: I also expect AI to be one of the major forces driving technological innovation and shaping the world in the coming decade, but without a crystal ball we can't really know what will happen. I made the mistake of being too optimistic about an invention with Fitbit and wearables, where I assumed a huge trend that did not materialize.\n\nWhen making the argument on a more general level, we could talk about the typical hype cycle new technologies and inventions usually go through. And following the phase of inflated expectations where everybody is extremely optimistic and bullish is usually the trough of disillusionment where investors and early adopters realize that the invention is still existing and getting better and better - but not at the high pace expected at the beginning.\n\nGartner\n\nAnd when looking at the hype cycle for emerging technologies Gartner released in August 2023, generative AI is at the peak of inflated expectations. Of course, this is only one opinion, but certainly not one speaking for Nvidia. It is implying that growth could be lower in the next few years. We must include in our calculation the possibility of investments in AI slowing down (growth in ChatGPT for example seems to stall right now).\n\nGoing hand-in-hand with the hype cycle is the productivity cycle. Another big problem that companies like Nvidia could be faced with in the next few years is the ramping up of productivity. According to an FT article, about 70 new fabrication sites are built and there is the risk of Nvidia being a victim of this productivity cycle as well - high supply is suddenly meeting lower demand which is generating a problem and is leading at least to lower prices.\n\nAt this point, we can also look at analysts' assumptions for Nvidia in the next ten years. Analysts are expecting revenue to grow with a CAGR of 16.87% in the next ten years and earnings per share are expected to grow with a CAGR of 16.94% in the same timeframe. Of course, we must point out that estimates beyond 2028 are based on only one or two analysts.

Recently, management of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) came up with extremely optimistic assumptions. The company raised its estimates for the total addressable market (\"TAM\") in 2027 from previously $150 billion to around $400 billion in only four years from now. This would result in a CAGR of more than 70% for the next four years. Other studies are less optimistic here, but are still expecting growth rates of 38% annually between 2023 and 2032 and see the global artificial intelligence chip market at $384 billion by 2032.\n\nWe also can point out that Nvidia has an extremely high market share. And as Jesse Felder pointed out (based on an article from Platformonomics), Nvidia's total data center revenue was 40% of the entire capital expenditures of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) (those businesses spending heavily into AI). Of course, this is just one statistic, but it is indicative of the extreme market share Nvidia currently has.\n\nIn my opinion, the market will never grow at the pace AMD is expecting and 38% growth is also optimistic, but the 22% top line growth that would be necessary for Nvidia in our calculation might be possible and sound like a goal that seems achievable in theory.\n\nFourth, the calculation also implies that Nvidia is able to generate a similar high percentage of revenue as free cash flow as in fiscal 2024. Right now, about 45% of revenue is ending up as free cash flow and Nvidia is reporting record high margins. For this calculation to make sense, we have not only to assume that Nvidia can grow its top line by 22%, but also that it is able to keep margins at the same high level as today.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nWe should not ignore that these margins are incredibly high, and it seems extremely unlikely for a business to be able to keep up these margins for 10 years.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAnd finally, we are calculating here with a 10% discount rate. For those that don't already know this (because sometimes we must spell out things that seem otherwise obvious): A 10% discount rate is telling us that investing in Nvidia (under the assumptions made above) would generate a 10% return on investment annually. It means your investment will increase 10% the first year and another 10% the next year. To double your investment, it would take a little more than 7 years. I am just saying this as those people being extremely bullish about Nvidia are probably assuming to double, triple, or quadruple their investment in the next few quarters. A 10% annual return is extremely good, but it doesn't go hand-in-hand with the dream of becoming rich quickly.\n\nAn FT article summed up the thesis quite well:\n\nSo Nvidia shareholders are making a bet that the law of large numbers does not apply, and that competition, innovation, and pricing pressure will not come to bear until at least the mid-2030s. Good to know.\n\nAnd I know there are examples of companies that continued growing for a long time although everybody was convinced the stock was overvalued - Amazon might be the perfect example here.

Amazon was always trading for a high P/E or P/FCF ratio, but the stock continued moving higher and higher. But Amazon collapsed following the Dotcom bubble.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nWe also don't have to assume Nvidia will completely collapse in the next few years - as Cisco and many others did in 2000 - it is enough if Nvidia is stagnating for several years to make it not a good investment at this point.\n\nTechnical Picture\n\nIn a final step let's look at the chart to determine the price levels where Nvidia could end up. In my opinion, it is extremely difficult to make predictions about how high the stock could run, and several biases take over our thinking. Extremely bullish people will assume the stock will continue to run higher and bearish people see the stock collapsing 80% or 90% in the next few quarters.\n\nNVIDIA Chart (TradingView)\n\nWhen using Fibonacci extension levels from the last bull run from 2018 to 2021, we got a potential target of around $863 (the 2.618 extension). However, Nvidia already exceeded this level (I started working on the article about two weeks ago). The next potential target would be the 3.618 Fibonacci extension around $1,180. At this level, we also have a white trendline which is combining the two highs of 2018 and 2021 and would generate a resistance level somewhere around $1,050 in the next few weeks/months for Nvidia.\n\nAccording to the chart, Nvidia could climb a little higher from here - but this is certainly not a scenario I would bet a single cent on. In my opinion, the stock is dangerously close to a price level where a correction is very likely, and looking at the chart the correction could already have started. And time will tell if it is a correction or a crash.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne aspect we should not forget here is even if the fundamental business continues to grow at a solid pace, there is still the risk of the stock collapsing. This is basically the theory of the hype cycle: The fundamental business can continue to grow, but sentiment among investors is swinging from one extreme to another and in the coming quarters it might swing from hype (extremely high stock prices, overvaluation) to disillusion (collapsing stock prices, low valuation multiples).\n\nI seldom rate a stock as \"Sell\" because it is dangerous to bet against momentum, to bet against a bubble and to bet against high quality businesses, but at this point, I would argue that Nvidia is not a \"Hold\" anymore. And there is still a difference between shorting (here I would be cautious) and selling a stock I hold in a portfolio (which might be a good idea at this point).", "start_char_idx": 11887, "end_char_idx": 15044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e16d31f-9af2-49f0-a027-620261cc6b71": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e16d31f-9af2-49f0-a027-620261cc6b71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/128.html", "file_name": "128.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7195, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4012c6be-5217-478d-b9a7-86a9d628192b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/128.html", "file_name": "128.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7195, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "da8877cef7bd821edfc579879ec1f002d54401a321ed9586637c90f69ef822cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35752c82-d981-425d-aec5-e029c8b35362", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/127.html", "file_name": "127.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 15044, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "52a9428dc07190e797f04412fc4be444e76219843f16bc599a425ba0f8d8a12b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e488b26-d923-499c-9429-a3395b357ca3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1d423398e2001c9c2ae9a23991cb96d79103c9d67cbfaf58fd8b741809a5d41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6973af9954907c9a9e88c36fb1cefa26f646d49fecda673e7e89c3b3084f21fd", "text": "Financial Network Wealth Management LLC lessened its holdings in shares of NVIDIA Co.

The event is expected to be a \u201ctransformative moment in artificial intelligence,\u201d as per the conference\u2019s website, Cramer wrote in an article on CNBC.\n\n\u201cI'd say centuries but that might be a tad hyperbolic. He's amazing,\u201d Cramer wrote, referring to Huang as a \u201cself-effacing genius\u201d and \u201cDaVinci.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the speech could potentially impact Nvidia\u2019s stock, which has seen a 77% surge year-to-date after more than tripling in 2023.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Dogecoin Killer\u2019 Shiba Inu Burn Rate Defies Market Action With 933% Surge, Daily Active Addresses Spike\n\nDespite the stock\u2019s impressive performance, Cramer believes that Huang deserves a day to \u201ctrace out a vision without a per share attached to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJensen is not the predictions sort of guy, but he's about big think as anyone who walks on this planet, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and I think he wants to stress sovereign AI, health care, and the planet \u2014 maybe even in that order,\u201d Cramer wrote.\n\nWhy It Matters: Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a record-breaking run, closing higher for a record ten straight weeks. The company\u2019s GTC 2024 is expected to further boost the stock, with Huang\u2019s keynote anticipated to explore the AI advances shaping the future.\n\nAnalysts have also been bullish about Nvidia\u2019s AI revolution, with Wedbush\u2019s Daniel Ives comparing it to \u201c10 PM in a party that goes to 4:30 AM.\u201d The company\u2019s rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD, has also been making strides, with KeyBanc analyst John Vinh predicting potential market leadership for AMD in cloud expansion.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding Nvidia, its supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM has also been under scrutiny, with its AI revenue growth in focus amid an overbought market.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Carnage: Bitcoin\u2019s Slide Below $69,000 Triggers Massive $700 Million Liquidation\n\nJim Cramer | Photo courtesy: Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The acclaimed chipmaker\u2019s share price dropped more than 5%, causing investors to wonder if this is the end of Nvidia\u2019s jaw-breaking rally. Last year, the company\u2019s share returned a staggering gain of 240% last year, and Nvidia\u2019s Q4 earnings report beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Currently, the shares of NVDA stock have risen nearly 60% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nDespite predictions of a sustained Nvidia sell-off in the coming days, I believe investors should not only hold on to their shares but add more to their portfolio once the stock dips.\n\nBelow are three reasons to buy the dip on NVDA shares.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArtificial Intelligence solutions remain in high demand\n\nNvidia dominates in both gaming GPUs and AI chips. In fact, the chipmaker dominates about 81% of the market for AI chips used in personal computers and data centers. Moreover, Nvidia\u2019s TensorRT software enables fast and efficient inference of AI models on edge devices. The chipmaker has effectively tackled and consolidated this new market in an unprecedented manner, and the only chipmaker likely to begin to rival it in the near future will be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which plans to sell billions worth of AI chips in 2024.\n\nEven when AMD begins selling AI chips, NVDA will keep its stronghold on the AI market for the foreseeable future, until its competitor ramps up significant sells.\n\nWall Street continues to be happy with NVDA\n\nWall Street analysts are excited about Nvidia\u2019s prospects. The company has an overwhelming \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating from analysts. Out of the 55 analysts covering Nvidia, 50 rate the stock as a \u201cBuy\u201d or \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d while 5 analysts have maintained a \u201cHold\u201d rating.\n\nNvidia\u2019s success in the AI market of course have created a lot of optimism. And it\u2019s not just Western markets either. Despite a lack of access to China\u2019s huge market, NVDA stock has made significant strides to sell AI chips to India-based companies and other companies based out of East Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese are just some of the reasons for Wall Street analysts to remain bullish on NVDA, despite the company encroaching upon its 12-month average price target.\n\nValuation is trading at a good spot\n\nNvidia\u2019s share price has been trading at a record high. However, the chipmaker\u2019s forward P/E ratio is still well below where it was 12 months ago. Then, the stock was trading at over 52.1x forward earnings.\n\nWith its recent rally, which has caused shares to appreciate more than 76%, the chipmaker\u2019s stock now trades for just 35.6x forward earnings. This puts Nvidia\u2019s earnings multiple below that of its key competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and right around where Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is trading. Moreover, a company like Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), which has seen its share price skyrocket over AI hype, is trading at 79.8x forward earnings, despite its AI platform still being in the pilot phase.\n\nThat\u2019s all to say, despite the valuation of NVDA stock looking expensive in certain regards, it is much less than where it was 12 months ago. Also, if the stock continues to dip, investors should see it as an opportunity to buy at a cheaper valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3431, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b12cc309-e973-41b9-887d-620f28d64c36": {"__data__": {"id_": "b12cc309-e973-41b9-887d-620f28d64c36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/135.html", "file_name": "135.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4087, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5259a835-1216-413f-8fae-2f0696aaab04", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/135.html", "file_name": "135.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4087, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "1c4c5f71f96598a10e79d5e82d84497b1ee337df2d621b6d8dbf2caf6fd4045c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "60650308-1b07-4a85-a9ed-54da915f507a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/135.html", "file_name": "135.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4087, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d6636dfc66182e3a7acceabf3395096280cfe87dc06ec123dd7019cdaeff9396", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f012484d-de17-414b-9a85-28cb15c68c82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8307391ab0956faf3788ebc88faf1c84f1cc503e34a2c2215b8b609d4881d66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ebc78a8dc84e6b8122f9f583efc818d331aa5af9e7483e51285d9c910a3a2a19", "text": "Moreover, a company like Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), which has seen its share price skyrocket over AI hype, is trading at 79.8x forward earnings, despite its AI platform still being in the pilot phase.\n\nThat\u2019s all to say, despite the valuation of NVDA stock looking expensive in certain regards, it is much less than where it was 12 months ago.

Muse wrote in a note to clients following the event.\n\nWhile bears may be worried that Nvidia could hit an \"air gap\" in 2025 following its roaring growth over the past year and the continued strong performance expected later this year, Muse didn't think Wall Street should be concerned about that prospect.\n\nThe company's just-revealed Blackwell chip architecture \"will likely be a significant growth driver in 2025,\" he commented, while sticking with his overweight rating and $1,200 target price.\n\nDon't miss: Super Micro plans to sell stock after nearly 1,000% rally over the past year\n\nTruist Securities analyst William Stein seemed to agree, writing that Blackwell's \"performance will stimulate demand and support elevated growth through at least 2025.\"\n\nHe added: \"We increasingly view a downturn in the next 1-2 years as unlikely.\"\n\nStein also called out Nvidia's expansive array of software partnerships - which could bring more workloads over to its hardware - and its launch of cloud-native microservices.\n\n\"This approach 'containerizes' high-performance models to ensure developers have easy and consistent access to software and models from Nvidia and other suppliers,\" he wrote. The move \"appears to be a way to fortify Nvidia's primacy in software and models with developers.\"\n\nHe has a buy rating and $1,177 target price on the stock.\n\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann called Blackwell \"likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed,\" positing that it's sold out \"well into 2025.\" He rates the stock at buy with a $1,400 target price.\n\nBernstein's Stacy Rasgon conceded that it was \"maybe\" hard for Nvidia to live up to all the hype surrounding this year's GTC, but he was nonetheless impressed by Huang's presentation.\n\n\"Blackwell appears likely to be strong, and the company's continued push not just on chips but on broader software and hardware ecosystems remains unmatched (and in our opinion, hard to stand against),\" he wrote. \"We still like what we see here.\"\n\nRasgon, who rates the stock at outperform with a $1,000 price target, began his note: \"Move over Taylor Swift, you're not the only one that can sell out a stadium.\"\n\nStifel's Ruben Roy noted the dramatic step up in inference performance of the new lineup relative to the H100, which he called \"noteworthy as the competitive landscape for longer-tailed inference workloads heats up.\"\n\nHe also highlighted the long roster of announced customers, which stood in contrast to the company's past H100 launch. \"The majority of AI innovators were named as expected Blackwell adopters at launch,\" he wrote.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3655, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3aa99be-3b8a-4432-9ef8-15bd204fe31b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3aa99be-3b8a-4432-9ef8-15bd204fe31b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/143.html", "file_name": "143.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4279, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b3a7856d-8ed2-4adf-a196-014b1ffd534e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/143.html", "file_name": "143.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4279, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a6277f194eaa2d1ee6149597edcb39e171874b141883ab2c7f78684dfec195e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0997498-aae8-4a9b-a5bb-cd2edf6693d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/143.html", "file_name": "143.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4279, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "6293c5c64e0e4cf83c2a38cb95930d0dbf4dedd2671172768cb7054c50ddf45c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b94d333-49a5-4dac-9090-05ef88c4c309", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "189f686ed9705cda240cb3162f882de7d2ff5d04e7f828bb6a147ea3110a6144", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "77b8a799ebe668c810e359e2ac98e123991e3aeda143ebdf8a905763ebd83e38", "text": "\"We still like what we see here.\"\n\nRasgon, who rates the stock at outperform with a $1,000 price target, began his note: \"Move over Taylor Swift, you're not the only one that can sell out a stadium.\"\n\nStifel's Ruben Roy noted the dramatic step up in inference performance of the new lineup relative to the H100, which he called \"noteworthy as the competitive landscape for longer-tailed inference workloads heats up.\"\n\nHe also highlighted the long roster of announced customers, which stood in contrast to the company's past H100 launch. \"The majority of AI innovators were named as expected Blackwell adopters at launch,\" he wrote.\n\nRoy has a buy rating and $910 target price on Nvidia shares.\n\nJPMorgan's Harlan Sur said Nvidia was \"further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time.\"\n\nThe company is a step or two ahead of the competition, he added.

That is because the Sep 20, 2024 $10.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NVIDIA shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NVIDIA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Semiconductor - General industry that ranks in the Bottom 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, 10 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.64 per share to $5.35 in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about NVIDIA right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

NVDA CEO Jensen Huang\u2018s GTC 24 keynote on Monday, an analyst predicts a big week for tech.\n\nWhat Happened: The GTC conference, both online and in-person, is dubbed the \u201cAI Woodstock\u201d by analyst Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. \u201cWith the AI Revolution now here, it all starts with the \u2018Godfather of AI\u2019 Jensen and Nvidia as this highly anticipated conference will be a launching pad for a number of products, use cases, [and] partnerships to launch the next phase of the AI Revolution on display,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nIves reiterated his prediction of a trillion-dollar AI spending wave triggered by Nvidia\u2019s chips.\n\nThe focus will be on details and pricing of the new Blackwell B100 chip, teased in November 2023, as per Ives. The B100 promises to surpass Nvidia\u2019s current H200 chip in power.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the demand trajectory for AI is undisputable with eye-popping Capex numbers from hyper-scale and Big Tech players Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and Meta among others speaking to the transformational spending around AI with Nvidia leading the way,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nSee Also: How To Buy Nvidia (NVDA) Stock\n\nThis week is crucial for companies to discover AI use cases and forge partnerships, as per the analyst.\n\nIves estimates AI budgets will reach 8-10% in 2024, a significant jump from less than 1% in 2023. He reiterates that every dollar spent on Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPU could generate $10-$12 in spending across software, IT services, and infrastructure.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Important: Nvidia, a leader in the AI revolution, has thrived since 2023, coinciding with ChatGPT\u2019s popularity. The company\u2019s performance and stock price have improved significantly.\n\nOn a 10-week winning streak, the stock has surged nearly 73% this year. This surge has placed Nvidia third in market cap, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nGTC 2024 is expected to further propel Nvidia\u2019s stock.\n\nNvidia settled Friday's session down 0.12% at $878.36, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: After Nvidia\u2019s Record 10-Week Winning Run, Analyst Says Investors Will Pay Attention To What\u2019s Next For AI Ecosystem At Upcoming Week\u2019s GTC 2024\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2185, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b212790c-a47f-4603-ab57-25ea4cdb35d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "b212790c-a47f-4603-ab57-25ea4cdb35d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/149.html", "file_name": "149.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2905, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "23ca2f0f-cae1-480c-bc62-826b523785c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/149.html", "file_name": "149.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2905, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f5db866c542b0c1efd229a4cf52711f30ce80fdfbf7ad7741e556199741c70ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1dd13ad9-3809-4fd0-abb1-ddd85d6c5dc0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/148.html", "file_name": "148.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2223, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "53cf72727fed9a8211a41397eb9ffb57487d08940eeeedb5ae67607d33a91af4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6dc32f07-dca8-40b7-8416-0571045f0be1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3bfd3143380a13abc8108aac799bc005108fded1c5b2435f8d44b2a5e21127d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "53f8981d231d58c6aaf4a5f7f63e4aa88f0d637310b0818e8ebb3051bb1bdec9", "text": "Loading... Loading...\n\nNvidia Corp. NVDA stock is looking unstoppable and has closed higher for a record ten straight weeks. The stock could receive a further boost this week as the company holds its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) 2024, with CEO Jensen Huang delivering the keynote between 4 p.m. EDT and 6 p.m. EDT on Monday.\n\nThe GTC 2024 will be a hybrid event, with in-person and virtual options for attendees. The keynote will be delivered at the SAP Center, near the San Jose McEnery Convention Center, in San Jose, California.\n\nHyped-Up Expectations: Nvidia has promoted the keynote as the stage where Huang will \u201cexplore the AI advances that are shaping our future.\u201d Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a CNBC interview on Friday that he expects a lot of discussion around a product roadmap. Nvidia has increased the cadence at which they are bringing new products to market, he added.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a discussion around the consistence that is building around their AI offerings. So, it\u2019s just not about hardware right. We are not considering Nvidia as a chip company anymore \u2014 systems company, software company, it\u2019s a networking company,\u201d the analyst said.\n\n\u201cI think, there is going to be a lot of discussion, again around the concept of the Nvidia AI ecosystem that Nvidia has been busy building and we\u2019re looking forward to the roadmap ahead,\u201d Roy said.\n\nSee Also: How To Buy Nvidia (NVDA) Stock\n\nValuation Dilemma: When probed whether the upward trajectory in the stock would continue, Roy said it would be all about the ecosystem. He noted an increase in revenues and margins, attributing it to the significant incorporation of software into Nvidia\u2019s system sales.\n\n\u201cThey are establishing cloud services, they are establishing concepts like AI factories, which include hardware and software,\u201d he said.\n\nBuy side investors, mainly professional investors, will be listening closely to what\u2019s next for the ecosystem and how Nvidia plans to participate in a very rapidly growing total addressable market (TAM), the analyst said. Compute, he said, has been characterized as a trillion-dollar TAM opportunity by Nvidia.\n\n\u201cGeneral-purpose compute, which historically has been serviced by standard general-purpose processors, now [are] moving to their GPUs and other forms of accelerated compute,\u201d he added.\n\nNvidia shares rose 0.35% last week compared to the 0.7% retreat by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index and a 0.1% edge down by the broader S&P 500 Index. The stock has gained 72.80% for the year-to-date period. It is the second-best performing S&P 500 stock after Super Micro Computer this year and the best-performing Nasdaq 100 stock.\n\nIt ended Friday\u2019s session down 0.12% at $878.36, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: Forget Gold And Bonds: Are These 2 AI Stocks The New Safe Havens In A Volatile Market?\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2869, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6dc32f07-dca8-40b7-8416-0571045f0be1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6dc32f07-dca8-40b7-8416-0571045f0be1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/15.html", "file_name": "15.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6254, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fd4fb8de-a25c-4070-85dc-92e02dd47acd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/15.html", "file_name": "15.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6254, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a6a42f0e7dea58fab3a61af7e94a013af2c45d4fe599976fa160b0f23ff7fb78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b212790c-a47f-4603-ab57-25ea4cdb35d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/149.html", "file_name": "149.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2905, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "53f8981d231d58c6aaf4a5f7f63e4aa88f0d637310b0818e8ebb3051bb1bdec9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "74cf4347-e725-4550-9d40-2b532cda7dc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f99dcc077518863157fa8a979b821365829c535319960e9f297eaa8243c8ff8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3bfd3143380a13abc8108aac799bc005108fded1c5b2435f8d44b2a5e21127d8", "text": "After the market close on Monday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) kicked off its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC), which some have dubbed the \"Woodstock of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\" Thousands of tech glitterati showed up in person to watch CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address, while millions more tuned in online.\n\nDuring the two-hour presentation, Huang expounded on the company's latest creations, collaborations, and partnerships, which will have a ripple effect across much of the tech world. This morning, investors are still digesting the impact of these announcements, which is causing something of a hangover in AI stocks -- likely following the old adage \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\"\n\nWith that as a backdrop, AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) tumbled 10.3%, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) slumped 5%, and chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) declined 2.8% as of 1:26 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- regulatory filings, financial reports, and changes to analysts' price targets -- was mixed in terms of company-specific news (more on that in a bit), suggesting much of the move was tied to Nvidia's day in the spotlight.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe unveiling of Blackwell\n\nNvidia announced its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, the successor to the company's highly sought-after Hopper processors, which have become the gold standard for AI processing. Huang called the updated B200 graphics processing unit (GPU) the \"world's most powerful chip\" for AI.\n\nThe GB200 superchip combines two B200 processors and a Grace CPU on a single board. Nvidia also developed a new network switch chip -- the NVLink -- that facilitates speedier communication while reducing the burden on the main processors.\n\nThese next-generation processors are being packaged into full systems, including the GB200 NVL72, which contains 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs in a complete rack-scale design. The liquid-cooled system also contains a 72-GPU NVLink, which \"acts as a single massive GPU,\" delivering 30 times faster performance for the large language models (LLMs) that underlie generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Nvidia's chief rival in the AI chip space, AMD's stock price reaction isn't unexpected, as Nvidia raised the bar for AI performance expectations.

If they're right -- and I believe they are -- each of these stocks has a vast opportunity ahead. For example:\n\nSupermicro has become the server of choice for many businesses looking to adopt AI. Furthermore, the company's building-block strategy allows companies to start small and easily expand their existing systems as the need arises.\n\nArm Holdings controls a vast library of intellectual property (IP) and will continue to see its licensing and royalty revenue grow from the accelerating adoption of AI.\n\nAMD offers alternatives to Nvidia's AI processors, as well as CPUs of its own design to accompany them, so it will also benefit from the secular tailwind represented by AI.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Supermicro is the least expensive of the group, with a forward price-to-sales ratio of 2, while AMD and Arm Holdings are selling for 9 times and 33 times forward sales, respectively.\n\nHowever, for those with a long-term outlook and stomach for some increased volatility, each of these stocks represents an intriguing opportunity, especially since it's still early days for AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NVDA, Financial), is pulling investment away from emerging markets, according to Banco BTG Pactual SA's founder, Brazilian billionaire Andre Esteves. Esteves notes that the high growth and wealth creation once associated with emerging markets now better describe regions like Silicon Valley.\n\nThe success of U.S. firms, especially in the AI sector, has attracted global investors. Esteves specifically mentioned the \"Magnificent Seven\" - Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, Financial), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN, Financial), Meta Platforms Inc. (META, Financial), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL, Financial), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA, Financial) - as key drivers behind the S&P 500 Index reaching new heights this year. This surge in AI stocks has made emerging-market equities appear undervalued in comparison, with their prices at record lows relative to the S&P 500, based on data dating back to 1987. Over the past three years, emerging-market stocks have dropped by 23%, contrary to a 15% increase in the MSCI ACWI Index.\n\nEsteves revealed that BTG's digital platform, primarily serving Latin American clients, has seen a significant demand for shares of Apple (AAPL, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial). Despite the current trend of investors moving towards stocks in Europe and emerging markets, as indicated by Bank of America Corp.'s latest fund manager survey, some analysts believe that a real shift towards emerging market equities will only occur once there is more certainty regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions.\n\nRelated stock tickers in the article:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1717, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16ae6ab8-dc70-42cb-a47b-24e34a912b08": {"__data__": {"id_": "16ae6ab8-dc70-42cb-a47b-24e34a912b08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/156.html", "file_name": "156.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6692, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "16980461-1867-4dc2-900b-886f5075239a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/156.html", "file_name": "156.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6692, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "84d7f0091ba76e9b5bb4d22fe5c4c1b8ce02cf7bcab94651c4862823588fc971", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c5331383-088b-4d88-bfcb-5cc033908fcc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/155.html", "file_name": "155.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 1717, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "26595797c5c9f2ede6c39cac2228816c3ed7619f6cf51f9c1b4f995563379c0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "43ae4c06-e0ef-4bdf-866b-f6a627727239", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9dc01815f862684cb226941815cdd8e1a90ee22e43a9018b8013a6097dfddf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1bc14c7f2246bf9ca7ca2c945424931702755fab547a37341b5a108a1f507b78", "text": "NVIDIA Co.

Next level AI performance,\u201d said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said in a post on Sunday.\n\nThe Jensen Huang-led company used GTC 2022\u2019s keynote that year to unveil the H100 AI chip based on the Hopper architecture.\n\nSee Also: Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks\n\nWhat We Know So Far: Nvidia first announced the B100 at the SC2023 Super Computing conference held in November. At a special address, the company teased the performance of B100 and suggested the next-gen AI chip will offer more than twice the AI performance of Hopper GPUs when it debuts in 2024. The B100 will succeed the Hopper H200 AI chip.\n\nOn the fourth-quarter earnings call, Nvidia\u2019s management said B100 demand will likely outstrip supply. Following the conference call, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Joseph Moore said Nvidia is heading into a major product cycle with the B100.\n\nInformation shared by leaker @XpeaGPU suggests the B100 will have 2 dies based on TSMC\u2019s CoWoS-L packaging technology, 8\u00d78-Hi HBM3e stacks for 192GB of memory.\u201d CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate is an advanced packaging technology that helps design and manufacture large processors.\n\nA year later, the B200 will launch with 12-Hi stocks and offer a beefy 288 GB memory, the leaker said. \u201cThis thing is a monster,\u201d he added.\n\nReports say Nvidia will use TSMC\u2019s 3nm processor technology for B100.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Important: Nvidia\u2019s pioneering moves in the AI chip market have given the company an edge over others. A key advantage for the company is its integrated AI offering, combining software, hardware and systems.\n\nStifel analyst Reuben Roy said in a CNBC appearance last week that Nvidia has increased the cadence at which it is bringing new products to market. \u201cI think, there is going to be a lot of discussion, again around the concept of the Nvidia AI ecosystem that Nvidia has been busy building and we're looking forward to the roadmap ahead,\u201d he said,\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock is on a tear, having gained about 73% for the year to date. It also notched up a record 10-week winning run with last week\u2019s modest 0.4% gain. Nvidia is now the third most-valued global corporation.\n\nNvidia ended Friday's session down 0.12% at $878.36, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: Nvidia Blazes Trail For 3 Further Phases Of AI Investment Opportunity, Says Analyst", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2675, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0ec915d-725b-4a13-b8ec-253eb6de1fee": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0ec915d-725b-4a13-b8ec-253eb6de1fee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/16.html", "file_name": "16.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2781, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "203a9dda-6beb-40f7-97d4-d2d270754521", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/16.html", "file_name": "16.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2781, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a46bf962d53320a12554e80438b03cb39d3980ec60ca59e867e96e2f71c5771a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "94ce0a17-90ae-4b6c-a301-00f05e8e32c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/157.html", "file_name": "157.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2714, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "bac6bc41dd028892f61bfb09adf5fea0101889e2b7aa1da4f9ac275aeea82da4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "03a8b5b8-efc4-4d94-ada6-c5e6931f320b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02cc71689fa41023c4c5b7370539c6bb904651bca2386b8dae4a0aeaed131460", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "229d1695b381ead0d2e4657a3752e2db3e0f87b7d6bfab0ec6ba402f568e07c6", "text": "CrowdStrike CRWD and NVIDIA NVDA have collaborated to combine the latter's powerful artificial intelligence (AI) computing capabilities with CRWD's Falcon XDR platform.

Loading...\n\nNvidia Corp NVDA is on the cusp of its annual artificial intelligence conference, with high expectations for the semiconductor giant to unveil news that could further fuel its stock\u2019s impressive rally.\n\nThe Nvidia GTC, a premier event for GPU technology that has evolved into a critical global AI conference for developers, is scheduled to run from March 18-21 in San Jose, California.\n\nNvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, is slated to kick off the event with a keynote speech that could potentially stabilize the stock\u2019s recent volatility and continue its significant upward trajectory of over 80% this year, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market capitalization recently surpassed $2 trillion, positioning it just $400 billion behind Apple Inc AAPL as the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, following Microsoft Corp MSFT.\n\nAnalysts are projecting an 81% surge in Nvidia\u2019s revenue to $110 billion this year, as demand for its premier chips for chatbots, image generators, and other AI systems skyrockets\u2014doubling the sales anticipated for Intel, the former PC boom leader, Reuters reports.\n\nCentral to Nvidia\u2019s continued dominance in the evolving computing era will be the launch of its next-generation high-end AI processor, expected to be named the B100, which will be crucial to the AI systems Nvidia sells and will likely begin shipping later this year.\n\nDespite the overwhelming demand for Nvidia\u2019s current AI chips leading to long wait times for developers, the B100 will likely carry a higher price tag than its predecessor, which is already priced over $20,000.\n\nTed Mortonson from Robert W. Baird & Co. anticipates that the conference will serve as a significant catalyst, offering more profound insights into Nvidia\u2019s industry penetration, drawing parallels to Apple Inc.\u2019s annual product launches.\n\nWith the spotlight on Huang to showcase innovations, especially those that could emulate the success of the H100 chips for data centers, Nvidia aims to solidify its dominance in the lucrative AI market.\n\nBank of America analysts, led by Vivek Arya, have aptly named the conference \u201cAI Woodstock\u201d and have raised their Nvidia price target to $1,100 from $925 in anticipation.\n\nEven after a significant 83% stock price increase in 2024, Nvidia trades at 34 times its expected earnings, a decrease from a PE of 58 a year ago. This suggests that analysts have significantly raised their future earnings estimates for Nvidia.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia via VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ.\n\nLoading...

In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n\nThe SPY SPY is currently trading around the mark of 511.69.

After blowing out sales estimates for three straight quarters, shares of the technology company have soared 265% over the last 12 months.\n\nNvidia is currently the clear leader in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) computing solutions; saying its powerful semiconductors are in high demand is an understatement. And even after the surge in the stock, there are still two good reasons to buy it now.\n\n1. The era of generative AI\n\nNvidia offers a diversified portfolio of products. It makes chips for gaming and offers a cloud-based gaming service. Its omniverse platform helps businesses design and operate manufacturing processes, and the company also supplies the burgeoning autonomous driving industry. But the data center segment is what has investors most excited.\n\nRevenue from that segment grew 409% year over year in the company's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28). In that quarterly report, CEO Jensen Huang said: \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.\" As Huang has previously noted, the era of generative AI is clearly taking off.\n\nBut there looks to be plenty more growth to come. The market size for generative AI is projected to more than quadruple from the 2023 level by the end of this decade. Nvidia will be a big beneficiary of that growth.\n\nData source: Statista.\n\n2. The geographical diversity of its business\n\nNvidia isn't just diversified with its products and services, it's also diversified geographically. As the graph below shows, continued sales growth doesn't just rely on the economy of any single country or region.\n\nImage source: Statista.\n\nEven though a global recession (or a decline in just one of its major markets) will affect Nvidia's performance, there is less risk for investors when sales are spread out geographically.\n\nThat helps stem some risk, and there are plenty of catalysts for more growth, too. Machine learning has been the major focus of AI development. That is likely to continue for at least several more years, but an increasing number of businesses in multiple sectors are also using AI technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's automotive segment could also grow quickly if self-driving vehicles become more mainstream. Autonomous and sensor technology is just one more area beyond machine learning where its sales could jump in the future. That potential is yet another reason to own the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The momo crowd aggressively bought ahead of GTC. The chart shows that the Arora call to hedge, so far, has been as perfect of a signal as it gets in real life. So far, there has been a sell the news reaction to the Nvidia conference.\n\nWe had previously shared with you that Nvidia has become the favorite of the momo crowd, replacing Tesla Inc TSLA for aggressively buying call options. Yesterday, the momo crowd turned NVDA stock into a casino. The momo crowd was buying stock options betting that NVDA stock would double by the end of the week \u2013 now think about it, doubling in NVDA would mean adding $2T of market value in one week. Even a simple analysis would have shown that NVDA stock doubling in a week was impossible, but do not tell that to the momo crowd.

Nvidia is clearly on a path to extend its AI dominance. It is still early in the AI race. Nvidia announced that Blackwell will be the successor to Hopper. Hopper is the present generation AI chip. Blackwell performs significantly better in both inference and training compared to Hopper. Blackwell enables generative AI on trillion parameter large language models. There is a new 800G backend switch on both Ethernet and InfiniBand.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

However, he remained optimistic about Nvidia\u2019s prospects, stating, \u201cThe team at Nvidia looks like they\u2019re really on top of their game right now\u2026 They\u2019ve done just an incredible job.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized Nvidia\u2019s significant role in the AI narrative, highlighting the company\u2019s adeptness at capitalizing on this trend.\n\nGriffin also noted the diminishing barriers to entry for large-language models, citing Anthropic, an AI startup backed by Google and Amazon, as a notable competitor to OpenAI.\n\n\u201cThe barriers to the production of a world-class model appear to be somewhat lower than we had thought they were 9 months ago or 12 months ago,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the next Nvidia is going to be,\u201d Griffin admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t know where AMD is going to land in their race against Nvidia, I don\u2019t know where Intel is going to land. But right now, Nvidia sits in a pretty good position,\u201d he concluded.\n\nNvidia saw a 1.51% increase to $933.04 in premarket trading on Wednesday, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: What Do Nvidia And Inflation Have In Common?

The graphics processing unit (GPU) company's share price was up 1% as of 3:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It had been up as much as 5.2% earlier in the day's trading.\n\nToday marks the beginning of the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in San Jose, California, and investors are excited about what the company might discuss and unveil at the event. The conference runs through Thursday and will likely play host to some major news from the artificial intelligence (AI) leader.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to give a keynote speech later today and host additional panels later in the week, and the conference will also include presentations from other artificial intelligence luminaries, more than 20 technical workshops on generative AI, and hundreds of exhibits. This year's GTC has become a focal point for what's on the horizon for artificial intelligence and other accelerated computing applications, and investors and industry watchers seem to have high expectations.\n\nIs it too late to buy Nvidia stock?\n\nNvidia is the world's hottest company, and its stock has been serving up incredible gains. The AI leader's share price has surged roughly 79% higher already in 2024, and it's also up 244% over the last year. The GPU specialist is now valued at roughly $2.21 trillion and ranks as the world's third-most-valuable company, trailing behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nGiven that the AI frontrunner's share price has seen such incredible gains and has already climbed today thanks to excitement about what could be unveiled at GTC, it's not unreasonable to question how much higher the stock can climb in the near term. Whether or not the company's AI announcements at this year's conference measure up to investors' expectations remains to be seen.\n\nDepending on what is or isn't shown, it's reasonable to expect that Nvidia stock will see some significant movement this week. But long-term investors shouldn't become overly fixated on what's shown and discussed at GTC this week. With Huang recently stating that AI could achieve human-level intelligence within the next five years, the long-term outlook is more exciting.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is still in the early stages of benefiting from the artificial intelligence revolution, and the stock continues to look like a worthwhile buy for long-term investors. The technology has been progressing at an incredible pace, and the company's GPUs are poised to play a key role in advancements over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

We'll review a bearish options set-up that wins if the semiconductor sector pulls back from highs. Considering this, I'm contemplating a bearish trade on Nvidia (NVDA) , utilizing a bear put spread as the trade structure. In the chart provided, I've highlighted a few notable points: RSI (Relative Strength Index): I've employed RSI to assess weakness. It's a straightforward tool - when the RSI exceeds the 70 area, a stock or ETF is deemed overbought. However, since securities can remain overbought for extended periods, it's essential to wait for the RSI to dip below 70 before considering a bearish trade setup. Downside Targets: Despite NVDA being in a bullish trend, any weakness could eventually attract buyers. Therefore, it's crucial to project downside targets to gauge how far NVDA might fall before attracting buying interest. Additionally, I've utilized Fibonacci retracements to project a downside target for NVDA. While the 50% and 68.2% retracement levels are commonly viewed as areas where a bounce may occur, I've also considered the 38.2% level, given NVDA's ongoing bullish trend. To provide further confirmation, I've also incorporated the rising 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), which aligns with the 38.2% retracement level, providing confirmation. The trade The trade structure I am using here is called a bear put spread. You may find trading platforms using other names like put debit spread or long put spread, but they all mean the same. I have used $870-$860 as the strikes for my bear put spread because at the time of writing this, NVDA was showing a price of 863 in the pre-market. As long as NVDA stays above $830, this trade would still be valid and one would simply need to pick out strikes based on where NVDA is trading at that time. If NVDA is hovering around $830, a 830-820 put spread could be considered. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia, YTD Here is my exact trade set-up: Buy $870 put, April. 12th expiry Sell $860 put, April. 12th expiry Cost: $500 Potential Profit: $500 If NVDA trades at or below my short strike by the expiration date, this trade can yield a 100% return on investment on the amount risked. With 5 contracts, this equates to risking $2500 to potentially gain $2500 -Nishant Pant Founder: https://tradingextremes.com Author: Mean Reversion Trading Youtube, Twitter: @TheMeanTrader DISCLOSURES: (None) THE ABOVE CONTENT IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY .

Muse wrote in a note to clients following the event.\n\nWhile bears may be worried that Nvidia could hit an \"air gap\" in 2025 after its roaring growth over the past year and the continued strong performance expected later this year, Muse didn't think Wall Street should be concerned about that prospect.\n\nThe company's just-revealed Blackwell chip architecture \"will likely be a significant growth driver in 2025,\" he commented, while sticking with his overweight rating and $1,200 target price.\n\nDon't miss: Super Micro plans to sell stock after nearly 1,000% rally over the past year\n\nTruist Securities analyst William Stein seemed to agree, writing that Blackwell's \"performance will stimulate demand and support elevated growth through at least 2025.\"\n\n\"We increasingly view a downturn in the next 1-2 years as unlikely,\" he added.\n\nStein also called out Nvidia's expansive array of software partnerships, which could bring more workloads over to its hardware, and its launch of cloud-native microservices.\n\n\"This approach 'containerizes' high-performance models to ensure developers have easy and consistent access to software and models from Nvidia and other suppliers,\" he wrote. The move \"appears to be a way to fortify Nvidia's primacy in software and models with developers.\"\n\nHe has a buy rating and $1,177 target price on the stock.\n\nBernstein's Stacy Rasgon conceded that it was \"maybe\" hard for Nvidia to live up to all the hype surrounding this year's GTC, but he was nonetheless impressed by Huang's presentation.\n\n\"Blackwell appears likely to be strong, and the company's continued push not just on chips but on broader software and hardware ecosystems remains unmatched (and in our opinion, hard to stand against),\" he wrote. \"We still like what we see here.\"\n\nRasgon, who rates the stock at outperform with a $1,000 price target, began his note: \"Move over Taylor Swift, you're not the only one that can sell out a stadium.\"\n\nStifel's Ruben Roy noted the dramatic step up in inference performance of the new lineup relative to the H100, which he called \"noteworthy as the competitive landscape for longer-tailed inference workloads heats up.\"\n\nHe also highlighted the long roster of announced customers, which stood in contrast to the company's past H100 launch. \"The majority of AI innovators were named as expected Blackwell adopters at launch,\" he wrote.\n\nRoy has a buy rating and $910 target price on Nvidia shares.\n\n-Emily Bary\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The H100 and H200 chips have become the go-to GPUs for AI applications, helping to rocket Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue over the last few quarters.\n\nIn its latest quarter alone, the company reported data center revenue of $18.4 billion. To put the segment\u2019s growth into perspective, Nvidia reported annual revenue of $27 billion for all of 2022.\n\n\u201cFor three decades we\u2019ve pursued accelerated computing with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI,\u201d Huang said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new industrial revolution. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.\u201d\n\nLike its prior Hopper GPUs, the Blackwell GPU will be available as a standalone GPU, or two Blackwell GPUs can be combined and paired with Nvidia\u2019s Grace central processing unit to create what it calls its GB200 Superchip.\n\nThat setup, the company says, will offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the Nvidia H100 GPU for large language model inference workloads while using up to 25x less energy. That energy savings is an important part of the story.\n\nNvidia customers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), are currently using or actively developing their own in-house AI chips as alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Part of the reason for that is so that they don\u2019t have to pay the tens of thousands of dollars Nvidia\u2019s chips are estimated to cost. But the other reason is that Nvidia\u2019s chips are especially power-hungry.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy talking up its energy savings with the Grace Blackwell Superchip, Nvidia is speaking directly to its customers\u2019 concerns.\n\nNvidia says Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) will be among the first companies to start offering access to Blackwell chips through their cloud platforms.\n\nIn addition to the Blackwell and Grace Blackwell chips, Nvidia also debuted its DGX SuperPOD supercomputer system. The DGX SuperPOD is made up of eight or more DGX Grace Blackwell 200 (GB200) systems, which include 36 Grace Blackwell 200 Superchips paired to run as a single computer. Nvidia says customers can scale up the SuperPOD to support tens of thousands of GB200 Superchips depending on their needs.\n\nSubscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe DGX SuperPOD also gets a new liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, which means the system is cooled off using fluid circulating through a series of pipes and radiators rather than straight-up fan-based air cooling, which can be less efficient and more energy intensive.\n\nThe Blackwell GPU and GB200 Superchip will be Nvidia\u2019s new top-of-the-line leaders when it comes to AI training and inferencing, which means they\u2019ll be in high demand the moment they hit the market.\n\nBut competitors AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) aren\u2019t sitting idly by; they are almost certainly working on their own chips with the hopes of eventually catching Nvidia.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

However, the stocks of other companies mentioned during the event saw a significant rise.\n\nWhat Happened: Despite unveiling a new processor design, Blackwell, Nvidia\u2019s shares fell by almost 2% in post-market trading. However, Huang\u2019s endorsements of other companies during the two-hour presentation in San Jose, California, led to a surge in their stock prices, reported Bloomberg.\n\nEngineering software companies like Synopsys Inc SNPS, Cadence Design Systems Inc CDNS, and ANSYS Inc ANSS experienced a rise of over 2% after Huang announced that they would be using the new Blackwell-based processors for AI enhancements in their products. Similarly, Dell Technologies Inc DELL saw a 3.2% increase after Huang praised the company for its enterprise systems.\n\n\"Everybody who is building these chatbots and generative AI, when you're ready to run it, you're going to need an AI factory. Nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell,\" said Huang, who nodded to CEO Michael Dell in the audience.\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Surge Amid Selling Pressure Over The Weekend: Analyst Says King Crypto To Reach $100K-$150K Post Halving In April\n\nOther companies, such as SAP SAP and ServiceNow Inc NOW, also witnessed a rise in their stock prices after Huang mentioned their use of Nvidia\u2019s platform for service development.\n\nWhy It Matters: Huang\u2019s keynote, though not immediately impactful on Nvidia\u2019s stock, significantly affected the stock market. This event follows a series of notable occurrences in the AI and tech industry, including Huang\u2019s assertion of Nvidia\u2019s technological dominance in the AI space, and the optimism surrounding Nvidia\u2019s GTC 2024 event.\n\nDespite the initial stock drop, Huang\u2019s influence on the market is evident, as his speeches are seen as potentially determining the course of the AI rally.\n\nThis event also adds to the anticipation surrounding Nvidia\u2019s future developments and partnerships, as highlighted by the enthusiasm expressed by Jim Cramer ahead of the GTC 2024 event.\n\nRead Next: Elon Musk Posted A Photo Of His Dog Wearing A Hat On St. Patrick\u2019s Day And Now Dogwifhat Is Surging 32% \u2014 Leaving DOGE, SHIB In The Dust\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

As of 11:07 a.m. ET today, the rally had faded somewhat, though the stock was still up 0.5%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker higher was increasing confidence in its artificial intelligence (AI) prospects on Wall Street, resulting in a pair of price target increases.\n\nA massive opportunity\n\nHSBC analyst Frank Lee maintained his buy rating on the stock while increasing his price target to $1,050. That suggests potential upside of more than 20% compared to Friday's closing price -- and on top of the stock's 500% gains since the beginning of 2023. The analyst cited Nvidia's expansion beyond graphics processing units (GPUs) into central processing units and software to power its AI-centric processors.\n\nNot to be outdone, analysts at Truist kept a buy rating on the shares, while increasing their price target to $1,177, which would represent potential upside of 34%. The company cited Nvidia's \"culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and massive investment in software, services & models\" as the reason for the company's growing lead in AI. The analysts went so far as to call Nvidia \"the AI company.\"\n\nHosting the \"Woodstock of AI\"\n\nThis growing confidence comes as Nvidia kicks off its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) today. The company is expected to unveil the next generation of generative AI-centric products.\n\nThe highly anticipated B100 aims to be the world's most advanced and powerful AI processor, and it could double the capabilities of its predecessor, the H100. Investors are waiting to hear from CEO Jensen Huang, who is expected to present the keynote address later today.\n\nThis highlights Nvidia's relentless innovation, which has helped catapult the company to the lead in providing processors used for generative AI.\n\nAfter Nvidia's meteoric rise over the past year or so, investors have begun to wonder if the rally could continue. The stock currently trades for 36 times forward earnings and 17 times forward sales, sending some shareholders to the sidelines.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, management forecasts triple-digit year-over-year growth in its 2025 fiscal first quarter, which ends in late April. Growth of that magnitude is certainly deserving of a premium, suggesting investors buckle in for the wild ride to come.

Think that's going too far? I don't. Here's why.\n\nIt's already the world's third-largest company\n\nAs of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest American company, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nCompany Name Symbol Market Cap (in billions) Microsoft MSFT $3,094 Apple AAPL $2,665 Nvidia NVDA $2,195 Amazon AMZN $1,811 Alphabet GOOG $1,761\n\nThat puts it 'only' $500 billion behind Apple and about $1 trillion behind Microsoft. To put it another way, Nvidia could surpass Apple if its stock were to rally by 23%; it could pass Microsoft if it rallied by 46%.\n\nWhy Nvidia could top Microsoft and Apple\n\nWhy do I think this will happen? Two words come to mind: Artificial Intelligence (AI). In short, the world has gone head-over-heels for AI. Consider this chart below:\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to Statista, the overall Generative AI market stood at $44.9 billion in 2023. By 2030, that figure is expected to rise to $207 billion. Generative AI, which can create images, stories, music, and video, is already upending entire industries. Marketing, software design, and customer service are just a few sectors likely to be transformed over the next decade as generative AI products grow in popularity.\n\nHow Nvidia will benefit\n\nIn short, Nvidia stands to profit from the AI revolution more than any other company, thanks to its leading share of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) market.\n\nGPUs are the 'brains' behind cutting-edge AI applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney. And to build those brains, companies like OpenAI need tens of thousands of GPUs -- often designed by Nvidia.\n\nTo sum up, thanks to its commanding place in the GPU market, I think Nvidia can ride the AI wave to the top of the list of most valuable companies in the world.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company rolled out its highly anticipated new generation of artificial intelligence chips dubbed Blackwell on Monday, with the first iteration known as GB200 poised to ship in 2024. The Blackwell processors, slated to be much larger and faster than the previous Hopper models, offers stronger processing power for companies training AI models. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia shares year to date Huang also highlighted software plans as the company looks to expand its AI ecosystem. One new product known as the Nvidia Inference Microservice aims to help companies using older graphics processing units for inference, which refers to the process of running large language models. \"In the keynote, he laid out a vision of an AI-powered future, with generative AI the building block of a new industrial revolution,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. \"With those grand ambitions in mind, the company presented a compelling set of new hardware, software, and systems to go one step further enabling that future.\" The event from Nvidia comes as enthusiasm for the AI darling shows no signs of easing, with the stock already up about 79% this year and 244% from a year ago. Shares slipped less than 1% before the bell. Here are some of the takeaways from the biggest Wall Street shops following the event. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari joined a handful of analysts turning more bullish on the chipmaker following the keynote event, boosting the firm's price target to $1,000 from $875. The new target represents 13% upside. Underpinning Hari's price hike is a \"renewed appreciation\" for the company's innovative capacity and range of customer relationships. He also highlighted Nvidia's \"compelling position\" as a \"key enabler\" in AI growth. Nvidia's latest announcements could prove a major boon for the AI darling, but Hari does anticipate some potential headwinds for competitors. \"While our expectation is for spending on traditional servers to recover, albeit modestly, in 2H24/2025, we envision the ongoing shift in data center spend away from general-purpose to accelerated computing continuing to weigh on Intel's fundamentals relative to Nvidia.\" The fast pace of innovation at Nvidia also means that Advanced Micro Devices may need to aggressively amp up its pace to \"keep up.\" Blackwell's heightened memory needs could also bode well for the dynamic random access memory market and companies such as Micron Technology , he added. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said Nvidia didn't shock investors with any unexpected updates, but he still raised his price target to $970 from $840. \"While NVDA once again highlighted its full stack / platform differentiation, we think some may have anticipated a bit more out of the Blackwell B200 launch,\" he wrote. The event reaffirmed the firm's \"long-standing positive thesis\" in the company's offering and future monetization opportunities. Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore called the keynote \"impressive,\" viewing Nvidia's Blackwell architecture as a sign of the company's ongoing dominance on the AI front. \"While there were no big surprises, the performance of the Blackwell family will raise the bar yet again, with aggressive claims on the rack scale product,\" he wrote. \"The company also continues to push forward in services, omniverse, and robotics.\" The performance claims for the Blackwell may take time for Wall Street to evaluate, but leaves them in a \"very strong position\" should they prove successful, Moore said. JPMorgan The Blackwell architecture not only solidifies the company's dominance, but also indicates that Nvidia \"remains 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors,\" according to JPMorgan's Harlan Sur.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3874, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0670d583-19b8-47b3-ab5e-cfe309bd39e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0670d583-19b8-47b3-ab5e-cfe309bd39e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/210.html", "file_name": "210.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5297, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "691c2c88-1382-4c3e-8ecd-ef579f5d2e12", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/210.html", "file_name": "210.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5297, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5bb6a858e4bfb4ddfbe82c03c506574ac39db81d9f0d9046af8ceeb954210ffb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d204005-ebdb-487c-80db-e0fad92d8695", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/210.html", "file_name": "210.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5297, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "cf4a61c938d1368c700d53a965a683c3c9bc5c6a6423ae01aecaa2fbb8a74312", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b803ab5-5ff5-472b-b547-af72f8fcee24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c47af73dd7ae7c03883ae1de6840137f0cd82f538d0af534978714eaf9c08125", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "141860c2f41efa2c645251043caecb2322bf439331acf28d02db4ef8e21b9705", "text": "Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore called the keynote \"impressive,\" viewing Nvidia's Blackwell architecture as a sign of the company's ongoing dominance on the AI front. \"While there were no big surprises, the performance of the Blackwell family will raise the bar yet again, with aggressive claims on the rack scale product,\" he wrote. \"The company also continues to push forward in services, omniverse, and robotics.\" The performance claims for the Blackwell may take time for Wall Street to evaluate, but leaves them in a \"very strong position\" should they prove successful, Moore said.

It will run Monday through Thursday at the SAP Center in San Jose, California. It's the first time since 2019 that this annual happening, widely considered the world's premier AI event, will be an in-person gathering.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang is kicking off the conference with a two-hour keynote address on Monday starting at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. Folks who are not attending can watch virtually.\n\nWhat can investors expect from GTC 2024?\n\nInvestors can expect the tech giant to announce a slew of new products and partnerships across its target markets, which include data center, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive. The data center platform should garner the bulk of Nvidia's conference focus. This business is its largest and fastest-growing by revenue, and offers the most products and services for helping customers enable AI capabilities.\n\nIn particular, investors can expect the company to provide details about its B100 graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing AI and high-performance computing workloads. They are based on Nvidia's next-generation architecture, Blackwell, and should have significantly increased processing power compared with GPUs based on its Hopper architecture.\n\nOn Nvidia's quarterly earnings call last month, CFO Colette Kress said, \"We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.\"\n\nThe event includes an impressive slate of speakers from Nvidia and other top companies, AI start-ups, and other entities working in the AI space. These include representatives from big tech behemoths such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\nOther than Nvidia, the company name that many investors might most associate with AI is OpenAI -- and a speaker from that privately held company is on the GTC itinerary.\n\nGenerative AI should make this year's GTC more exciting than usual\n\nThe main reason this year's GTC has surely been more eagerly anticipated than usual among investors, tech enthusiasts, and entities across sectors and geographic regions can be summed up in three words: generative artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis tech exploded onto the scene in November 2022, when OpenAI broadly released its ChatGPT chatbot, which immediately became wildly popular. Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content using a wide range of input types.\n\nCiting \"unprecedented demand for ChatGPT inside organizations,\" OpenAI followed up the launch of its free product with the debut of ChatGPT Enterprise in August 2023. This offering provides enterprise-grade security and privacy, among other features not included in its free offering.\n\nAI stock craze\n\nThe launch of generative AI kicked off a run-up in the stocks of companies connected to the technology. Nvidia and select other AI stocks had already been widely followed, thanks largely to what we'll call non-generative AI. But starting in 2023, their popularity among investors got a massive boost.\n\nNvidia's data center business growth has been astounding over the last few quarters, driven by the voracious demand for its products and services that enable generative AI capabilities. Its stock's performance reflects its blockbuster financial results and investor enthusiasm about future growth.\n\nIn 2024, shares of Nvidia had soared by 77.4% through March 15, making the stock the second-best performer on the S&P 500 index, behind Super Micro Computer.

Loading...\n\nInvestors are grappling with the decision to sell or hold onto their shares in NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, following the company\u2019s astronomical rise and recent stock dive.\n\nWhat Happened: Nvidia\u2019s stock soared over 200% in 2023, largely due to the artificial intelligence buzz. However, the stock took a hit, diving more than 5% on Friday and an additional 2% on Monday. Despite these dips, the stock is still up by around 73% this year, CNBC reported on Wednesday.\n\nSome investors, such as Vahan Janjigian, chief investment officer at U.S.-based Greenwich Wealth Management, have already sold part of their Nvidia shares due to concerns over the stock\u2019s valuation. Janjigian has instead chosen to invest in Nvidia through exchange-traded funds.\n\nJanjigian says he had a \"big position\" in Nvidia until recently. \"But I got a little nervous because I do think the stock is overvalued, especially when you look at it on a price-to-sales basis. It's selling for about 35 times sales, which is very high compared to some of the other technology companies,\" he said, according to the report.\n\nSee Also: Crypto Community Lost Staggering $104M In Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Phishing Scams In 2024: Ethereum Users Hit The Hardest\n\nPaul Gambles, the managing partner of MBMG Family Office Group, advised selling Nvidia immediately, predicting a possible 50% to 90% decline \u201csoon\u201d. He also suggested that investors should have been buying puts when they were cheaper, given Nvidia\u2019s sometimes high volatility.\n\nHe said, \"Although whether that happens now or next year is pretty much impossible to tell but precedent would indicate that it's time to be worried \u2013 the longest spell without an \u2018event' was 2012-2018.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Louis Navellier of Navellier and Associates remains bullish on Nvidia, stating that it\u2019s not time to sell any Nvidia shares yet. After Nvidia\u2019s recent selloff, he reiterated his position, indicating no plans to sell Nvidia and predicting it to be a $1,000 stock in the upcoming months.\n\nWhy It Matters: Nvidia\u2019s recent performance and the differing investor opinions highlight the volatility and risks tied to high-momentum stocks, particularly those driven by the AI sector. Nvidia\u2019s stock surge and subsequent decline serve as a cautionary example of the swift and sometimes unpredictable nature of stock market fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, the AI sector has been a significant driver of the stock market, with both the U.S. and China investing billions into their respective AI capabilities. This has led to concerns about a potential correction in the AI trade, particularly given Nvidia\u2019s recent stock reversal.\n\nRead Next: Floki Spikes To 27-Month Highs With 69% Rally, Trader Sees It As \u2018The Next Doge\u2019\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

Shares of the AI darling are up a staggering 267% over the last 12 months and 79% year to date. Tech companies across the world covet its graphics cards like rare jewels and CEO Jensen Huang is as in-demand as some heads of state.\n\nAnd on Monday, he\u2019ll kick off Nvidia\u2019s annual GTC conference with a two-hour keynote at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., outlining what\u2019s ahead for the company in the year ahead. In prior years, Nvidia has used the show to debut some of its biggest products.\n\nIn 2022, it announced its Hopper graphics architecture and H100 graphics processing unit, which is now the go-to card for companies training and deploying AI models. This year, Nvidia is widely expected to debut Hopper and the H100\u2019s successors, kicking off what could be a new rush on the company\u2019s products.\n\nThe new architecture, codenamed Blackwell, and GPU, dubbed the B100, are anticipated to offer far better performance when it comes to running models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3. Nvidia isn\u2019t exactly hiding its plans for the B100. During the Supercomputer 2023 conference, the company showed off a slide outlining the GPU\u2019s potential capabilities compared to the H100 and H200 cards.\n\nIn addition to the Blackwell architecture and B100 card, Nvidia will also likely give attendees and viewers a look at the latest advancements in its CUDA software.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage at GTC 2024 on March 18 in San Jose. (Ross D. Franklin/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe platform, which lets programmers take advantage of a GPU\u2019s processing capabilities for AI and other applications, is an essential part of Nvidia\u2019s overall enterprise strategy and helps lock in developers who build on Nvidia\u2019s software, virtually ensuring they\u2019ll stick with Nvidia\u2019s products in the future.\n\nNvidia could also announce that it will begin producing its H20 AI chip for the Chinese market. The chip, according to Reuters, is meant to serve as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s more powerful H100 and H200 chips. The US prohibits Nvidia from selling those chips to Chinese customers for fear that the Chinese military and government will use them to develop advanced AI applications to rival the US's.\n\nThose are the big stories we\u2019ll be watching from GTC, but we\u2019ll also likely get plenty of other announcements and debuts from Nvidia and its partners.\n\nSome 300 exhibitors are set to take part in the conference and speakers ranging from OpenAI\u2019s COO Brad Lightcap and Meta\u2019s vice president of AI research Joelle Pineau to Microsoft\u2019s vice president of generative AI S\u00e9bastien Bubeck set to make appearances at the show.\n\nYahoo Finance will be on the ground, bringing you all of the biggest news from the conference and chatting with some of Nvidia\u2019s top executives.

He told CNBC that there is $100 trillion of industry that can be transformed with AI.\n\n\u201cGeneral purpose computing \u2014 general purpose almost anything, like a general purpose instrument of any kind \u2014 it\u2019s not very efficient,\u201d Huang said.\n\nBy using products that are designed for specific applications, you become much more efficient, which requires less energy and helps to lower costs, he said.\n\nCheck This Out: Nvidia \u20181-2 Steps Ahead of Competitors\u2019 After Blackwell GPU Reveal At GTC 2024, Analyst Says\n\nNvidia announced its next-generation chip architecture this week called Blackwell. Blackwell GPUs contain 208 billion transistors and will cost somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000, the Nvidia CEO said, adding that Blackwell computers will replace thousands of general purpose computers.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest chip the world\u2019s ever seen. This is beyond the limits of physics. We had to invent some new technology to make it possible to do this,\u201d Huang said.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Blackwell platform will help dramatically reduce energy usage. The chips make it possible for the computer to write its own software, which is referred to as artificial intelligence, he explained.\n\nWhen you ask a computer with this technology a question, it understands the words and the meaning behind the words based on the context of the conversation, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of waste in the world \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of waste in just about every single industry. The challenge is that we\u2019ve never been able to use a computer to understand the information of that industry .. Te\u2019ve been able to sequence genes, but we\u2019ve never been able to understand what it means,\u201d Huang said.\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nCramer asked Huang why Nvidia is currently valued at more than $2 trillion. The Nvidia CEO said the company serves the accelerated computing and AI niche, which is the foundation for computing going forward, and he reiterated that there is $100 trillion of industry that can be transformed with AI.\n\n\u201cThe single-most important instrument of humanity is computing and now we have computers that could understand information of all different kinds.

That acquisition would have added Arm's chip designs, which are already used in more than 95% of the world's mobile devices, to Nvidia's massive chipmaking business.\n\nHowever, that deal was terminated in 2022, after antitrust regulators claimed it would give Nvidia an unfair advantage against its industry peers. Nvidia would no longer have paid Arm licensing fees for its own Arm-based Tegra chips, but other chipmakers -- including Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple -- would still have paid Nvidia licensing fees for those designs.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLast September, SoftBank spun off Arm in an IPO at $51 per share. Investors initially shrugged at that offering, since its growth was cooling off and its valuations were high. However, the stabilization of the smartphone market and expansion of the AI market brought back the bulls -- and its stock soared to its current price of about $127.\n\nSo could Arm follow Nvidia's footsteps and become the next hot AI chip stock? Or will it struggle to justify its soaring valuations?\n\nArm's growth stabilized over the past year\n\nArm doesn't manufacture any chips of its own. It only designs CPUs and licenses those designs to other chipmakers. Arm-based CPUs generally aren't as powerful as the x86 CPUs produced by Intel and AMD, but they're more compact and power-efficient, which makes them well-suited for mobile devices.\n\nHowever, Arm's heavy exposure to the smartphone market is a double-edged sword. Its licensing fees and royalties soared in fiscal 2022, which ended in March 2022 as smartphone makers sold more 5G devices, but they declined in fiscal 2023 as the 5G upgrade cycle ended and the macro headwinds rattled the market.\n\nOn the bright side, Arm's pricing power in mobile chip designs kept its gross margin in the mid-90s even as its revenue growth cooled off, and its adjusted operating margins rose even as it ramped up its spending on new chip designs. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Arm's revenue rose year over year again, its gross margin held steady, and its adjusted operating margins expanded.\n\nStory continues\n\nMetric FY 2022 FY 2023 9M 2024 Revenue growth (YOY) 33% (1%) 13% Gross margin 95% 96% 95% Adjusted operating margin 27% 29% 43%\n\nData source: Arm Holdings. YOY = Year-over-year.\n\nThe company attributed that recovery to the stabilization of the smartphone market, robust demand for its AI-enabled Armv9 handset chip designs that have higher royalty rates, market share gains for its Armv9 chips in the cloud server market, and strong sales of Arm-based chips for advanced driver assistance systems in new vehicles. All of those tailwinds offset its headwinds across the Internet of Things, embedded, and automotive microcontroller markets.\n\nThe stock looks richly valued relative to Arm's growth\n\nFor the full year, Arm expects its revenue to grow 18%-20%, its adjusted operating margin to expand to a midpoint of 53%, and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to come in between $1.20 and $1.24. That outlook seems healthy, but Arm's stock already trades at 40 times this year's sales and 105 times this year's earnings.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c90362d7-da8c-4863-b1af-a36d9ba4a72d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c90362d7-da8c-4863-b1af-a36d9ba4a72d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/226.html", "file_name": "226.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5683, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20b9380f-533b-43a7-a82d-2b3057c01072", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/226.html", "file_name": "226.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5683, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "7e76ee0bf8742b22b18afc37856bd78874ec147e115bf18832a7ba98fa2c5b43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3dc1555-eb52-49a1-b5db-5acbec523099", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/226.html", "file_name": "226.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5683, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "8357159513d787bf8435526c57fe7b734d386aaf20fff4ace31a6d21e1621c4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "232e0353-744a-4057-afdb-7f1498b11afe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1b53f5308e58481dbb89eed0737aac2b0150d0e84ab0ebbcee3d2e70803ff29a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ab7bb6aa3af6f93e2c69301bc1a909088e04d901bd72ddc206a97f1f7313169f", "text": "All of those tailwinds offset its headwinds across the Internet of Things, embedded, and automotive microcontroller markets.\n\nThe stock looks richly valued relative to Arm's growth\n\nFor the full year, Arm expects its revenue to grow 18%-20%, its adjusted operating margin to expand to a midpoint of 53%, and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to come in between $1.20 and $1.24.

But based on those estimates, its stock still looks pricey at 82 times forward earnings and 34 times next year's sales.\n\nBy comparison, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 81% and 90%, respectively, in fiscal 2025, which ends next January. However, Nvidia trades at only 36 times forward earnings and 20 times this year's sales.\n\nArm seems to be fetching a premium valuation as more chipmakers license its higher-end chip designs for new AI applications. But investors shouldn't confuse Arm's CPU designs with Nvidia's GPUs, which play a much more important role in processing machine learning and AI tasks. Arm also still generates most of its revenue from the cyclical smartphone market instead of cloud servers or connected vehicles.\n\nArm isn't the next Nvidia\n\nArm's business still has room to grow as it rolls out its pricier chip designs, but the AI hype is inflating its valuations to unsustainable levels.

Loading...\n\nWedbush analyst Matt Bryson reiterated Nvidia Corp NVDA with an Outperform and a $1,000 price target.\n\nNvidia has unveiled four new discrete hardware offerings as part of its Blackwell launch, all based on its latest chip technology but differentiated by packaging and systems design.\n\nThe lineup includes the B100, a direct replacement for the H100 architecture with a consistent TDP, available as an HGX offering.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia \u20181-2 Steps Ahead of Competitors\u2019 After Blackwell GPU Reveal At GTC 2024, Analyst Says\n\nThe B200 features two dies linked via a 10 TB/s Nvidia High Bandwidth Interface, functioning as a single chip and available in an 8 GPU HGX variant.\n\nThe GB200 combines two B200s (four dies) with a Grace processor, while the GB200 NVL72 is a liquid-cooled rack-scale system comprising 36 GB200 Superchips designed to act as a single GPU. These systems can be interconnected through Nvidia\u2019s new X800 switches to form large clusters with minimal transport latency.\n\nBryson\u2019s key takeaways include the B100 offering an easy upgrade path that could drive significant demand for Nvidia\u2019s next-generation parts. He said the packaging and systems architectures of Nvidia\u2019s new offerings promise substantial performance gains.\n\nThe analyst noted that the B100 doubles training performance compared to the Hopper architecture due to Nvidia\u2019s FP4 format. Bryson stated that the B200 quadruples training performance is further enhanced when packaged with Nvidia\u2019s Grace processor in the GB200 and GB200 NVL72 systems.\n\nHe added that the latter delivers an impressive 720 petaflops of training and 1.4 exaflops of inference power.\n\nNvidia\u2019s advancements affirm its leadership in the AI accelerator market, bolstered by its system-level architecture innovations that competitors may find challenging to replicate, per the analyst.\n\nNvidia\u2019s position is further strengthened by its IP/competencies, partly from the Mellanox acquisition, and its ability to set AI standards due to its scale, Bryson said. Major cloud CSPs, including Microsoft Corp MSFT Azure, Amazon.Com Inc AMZN AWS, Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL Google Cloud, and Oracle Corp ORCL Oracle Cloud, have committed to integrating the GB200 NVL72, signaling widespread industry support.\n\nThe introduction of the B100 and B200, each with 192 GB of HBM memory\u2014up from the H100\u2019s 80 GB\u2014indicates a positive outlook for DRAM vendors due to the premium pricing and margins for HBM, as well as for the broader memory complex, given the resources allocated to meet HBM requirements, Bryson noted.\n\nThe price target is based on a target PE multiple of ~36X applied to Bryson\u2019s fiscal 2026 estimates, plus net cash of $6.54 per share, somewhat above the 2-year average (31X) or the 5-year average (30X). The analyst noted that the higher valuation is supported by strong current fundamentals that are again likely to yield more robust growth than is currently being modeled for Nvidia.\n\nBryson projects first-quarter revenue and EPS of $24.01 billion and $5.41.\n\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann flagged how Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang heralded the rise of generative AI as a burgeoning industry, marking a shift towards accelerated hardware and software (HW/SW) computing as the leading approach.

Shares of the AI darling are up a staggering 267% over the last 12 months and 79% year to date. Tech companies across the world covet its graphics cards like rare jewels and CEO Jensen Huang is as in-demand as some heads of state.\n\nAnd on Monday, he\u2019ll kick off Nvidia\u2019s annual GTC conference with a two-hour keynote at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., outlining what\u2019s ahead for the company in the year ahead. In prior years, Nvidia has used the show to debut some of its biggest products.\n\nIn 2022, it announced its Hopper graphics architecture and H100 graphics processing unit, which is now the go-to card for companies training and deploying AI models. This year, Nvidia is widely expected to debut Hopper and the H100\u2019s successors, kicking off what could be a new rush on the company\u2019s products.\n\nThe new architecture, codenamed Blackwell, and GPU, dubbed the B100, are anticipated to offer far better performance when it comes to running models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3. Nvidia isn\u2019t exactly hiding its plans for the B100. During the Supercomputer 2023 conference, the company showed off a slide outlining the GPU\u2019s potential capabilities compared to the H100 and H200 cards.\n\nIn addition to the Blackwell architecture and B100 card, Nvidia will also likely give attendees and viewers a look at the latest advancements in its CUDA software.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage at GTC 2024 on March 18 in San Jose. (Ross D. Franklin/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe platform, which lets programmers take advantage of a GPU\u2019s processing capabilities for AI and other applications, is an essential part of Nvidia\u2019s overall enterprise strategy and helps lock in developers who build on Nvidia\u2019s software, virtually ensuring they\u2019ll stick with Nvidia\u2019s products in the future.\n\nNvidia could also announce that it will begin producing its H20 AI chip for the Chinese market. The chip, according to Reuters, is meant to serve as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s more powerful H100 and H200 chips. The US prohibits Nvidia from selling those chips to Chinese customers for fear that the Chinese military and government will use them to develop advanced AI applications to rival the US's.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose are the big stories we\u2019ll be watching from GTC, but we\u2019ll also likely get plenty of other announcements and debuts from Nvidia and its partners.\n\nSome 300 exhibitors are set to take part in the conference and speakers ranging from OpenAI\u2019s COO Brad Lightcap and Meta\u2019s vice president of AI research Joelle Pineau to Microsoft\u2019s vice president of generative AI S\u00e9bastien Bubeck set to make appearances at the show.\n\nYahoo Finance will be on the ground, bringing you all of the biggest news from the conference and chatting with some of Nvidia\u2019s top executives.

He emphasized the company\u2019s potential to revolutionize enterprise with its software, which can significantly enhance processes and innovation while reducing costs across various sectors, reported CNBC.\n\n\u201cThe sum of all that Nvidia\u2019s doing will indeed create the next industrial revolution, because Nvidia\u2019s about the speed with which we can arrive at smarter, better answers,\u201d said Cramer.\n\nAlthough Nvidia\u2019s business might not be as tangible as that of its tech peers, such as Microsoft Corp MSFT, Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG, or Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Cramer believes it is equally valuable. He highlighted the inefficiencies of current digital processes compared to what Nvidia\u2019s technology can achieve.\n\n\"If you want to create wealth in the stock market, sometimes you need to make a leap of faith, that you're getting it right with [CEO] Jensen [Huang], because you have to, because, otherwise, you won't see it coming, whatever the heck it is,\" Cramer said.\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin Braces For Wild Ride: Analyst Predicts Unprecedented Volatility, Says Apex Crypto Could Hit $90,0\n\nWhy It Matters: Nvidia has been making significant strides in the tech industry.

But attention has turned to the Summary of Economic Projections, also known as the dot plot, to see if the FOMC has been spooked by the latest hot inflation data.\n\nCarol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office says: \"The earliest possible cut could be June, though we wouldn\u2019t be shocked to see that delayed to later in the year if the data continues to come in hot as recent data has.\"\n\nWells Fargo's economists say that \"beneath the robust headline figures, we see building evidence that the labor market is cooling and inflation is still slowing on trend.\"\n\nThey \"look for 100 bps of easing in total this year and another 100 bps of easing over the course of 2025 to bring the fed funds target range to 3.25%-3.50% by year-end 2025.\"\n\nReddit (RDDT) headlines the IPO calendar with its much-anticipated debut. The social media company is expected to price 22M shares between $31 and $34 per share, raising up to $748M with the deal.\n\nSA Analyst Mountainside Research is skeptical. They say there \u201care concerns about their lack of profitability, reliance on advertising. (and) their optimistic valuation,\u201d adding \u201cbased on how other recent IPOs have been received by the market, Reddit may have a rocky start.\u201d\n\nLooking to earnings\n\nIt\u2019s a loaded end the of the week. Nike (NKE) and FedEx (FDX) report on Thursday.\n\nSeeking Alpha analyst Bela Lakos says from a valuation standpoint, Nike \"provides little upside potential at the current levels and \"the challenging macroeconomic environment, including the conflict on the Red Sea and its impacts on the Suez Canal traffic, is likely to have a meaningful impact on the upcoming results.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3464, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e3c8d0c-7fd0-4fe6-965e-4005a2c26251": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e3c8d0c-7fd0-4fe6-965e-4005a2c26251", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/238.html", "file_name": "238.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6842, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a614c65-c945-4b8f-a7b9-84676d3ca7d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/238.html", "file_name": "238.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6842, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "0e21ca6a134ea6ff408dbca631cbe96bd4516880621ed9370dfd960e1a2df840", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "11605ec7-2dbf-4e73-8838-db3fea873b4f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/238.html", "file_name": "238.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6842, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "60351b5bf6d7a9b2666a896b0036c57872d136a9b2af8519d015d376d7ae136b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a17c4f51-c59c-4ff3-b3ce-29b1e49808e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6044df9d78aea403e9d8e7bb86f913a2dd81edcddb16823f11a7c349f7e01752", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "305d724cc2acab8d1de2c771aeee1b6da885c431509f54c4ff07f1ec0c0dd2dc", "text": "SA Analyst Mountainside Research is skeptical.

That\u2019s according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAs part of a criminal grand jury probe, the U.S. prosecutors in Virginia have been sending subpoenas and seeking responses from the tech giant, the owner of Instagram and Facebook. The officials are investigating whether the company\u2019s social media platforms are enabling and profiting from the illicit sale of drugs. The FDA is also assisting the probe.\n\nAnd Tesla (TSLA) plans to raise prices for its Model Y midsize electric SUV in both the U.S. and several European countries.\n\nThe company said that prices in the U.S. will increase by $1,000 for all Model Y cars on April 1. Tesla (TSLA) followed that up by saying that Model Y prices would rise across a number of countries in Europe on March 22 by about EUR 2K or the equivalent in local currencies. TSLA stock has been hamstrung by recent price cuts and is one of the lowest-peforming stocks in the S&P year to date.\n\nFor income investors\n\nHere are some companies that have an ex-dividend date coming next week:\n\nKohl\u2019s (KSS) has its ex-dividend date on March 19 with a payout date of April 3.

Although these partnerships have not yet translated into increased earnings for the companies, Cramer suggested they could be significant market winners in the future.\n\n\u201cThe knowledge isn\u2019t always in the conference call, or the analyst reports\u2014sometimes it\u2019s right here, like the purloined letter, hidden in glorious plain sight,\u201d Cramer said. You just have to get off the desk and find it by going to Nvidia\u2019s GPU technology conference and seeing who\u2019s showing off their wares at the most important AI event of the year.\u201d\n\nSee Also: This Could Be A Gamechanger For Natural Gas In Europe\n\nWhy It Matters: Earlier this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that Nvidia is not just a chipmaker but an accelerated computing company focusing on offloading workloads and running them \u201cinsanely fast.\u201d\n\nDespite a drop in Nvidia\u2019s stock following Huang\u2019s keynote presentation, Cramer predicted that Nvidia\u2019s efforts would create the next industrial revolution.\n\nHowever, the stock\u2019s performance has been mixed, with a dip following Huang\u2019s GTC 2024 keynote presentation. Despite this, analysts have praised the AI chipmaker\u2019s GTC unveilings as \u201cnothing short of amazing.\u201d\n\nRead Next: \u2018Dogecoin Killer\u2019 Shiba Inu Burn Rate Defies Market Action With 933% Surge, Daily Active Addresses Spike By 8%\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

The tech giant holds more than an 80% share and sells a broad portfolio of products and services to power AI projects.\n\nThe secret of Nvidia's success is simple: The company sells the fastest chip around. Today, this is the H100 graphics processing unit (GPU), but Nvidia is set to launch new products in the months and years ahead as it pours investment into research and development (R&D). The company's R&D spending rose 18% last year to $8.6 billion.\n\nAll this means Nvidia's share price performance may be far from over -- and this week in particular, it may get a boost. Nvidia's holding its GTC AI Conference from Monday through Thursday, featuring a keynote speech by CEO Jensen Huang and more than 900 sessions involving industry experts. This is the first time the conference is being held in person since prior to the pandemic, so excitement is brewing. Should you rush to buy Nvidia stock this week to get in on the action? Let's find out.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHuang's GTC keynote\n\nFirst, a few notes about what to expect. Investors will listen closely to Huang's Monday keynote, focused on what's to come in accelerated computing, generative AI, and robotics. This should offer us a view of the environment for both the company and the industry in the coming year.\n\nSome speculate that this week, Nvidia will introduce the much-anticipated Blackwell, its next-generation GPU architecture, and specifically the B100 AI chip. The B100 to power AI innovation will more than double the performance of Nvidia's soon-to-be released H200 when it comes to inference, according to Videocardz.com, citing an earlier Nvidia presentation.\n\nThe company hasn't announced a specific release date for Blackwell, but information offered so far suggests it should happen later this year. During the GTC conference, Huang may also update the crowd on other products, or even collaborations with partners.\n\nStory continues\n\nA risk Nvidia faces is the idea that rivals could eat into its market share, so the company's ability to continually improve its GPUs and stay ahead is critical. That's why news about Blackwell and any other clues about the company's innovations are such important points to watch.\n\nAll this could support the idea that Nvidia's spectacular AI growth is far from over -- and may just be getting started. If this is the case, the record levels of earnings we've seen so far aren't set to fall, and new records could be right around the corner. Optimism about this may translate into strong share performance for Nvidia in the coming days.\n\nA long-term buy\n\nSo, let's get back to our question: Should you buy shares of Nvidia this week to potentially benefit from the momentum?

The trend has continued in 2024 -- Nvidia is up 80% year to date and is again the best-performing S&P 500 component.\n\nThere's certainly a degree to which hype is now driving Nvidia's unstoppable run. But the fundamental reason the stock is soaring is earnings growth. Specifically, growth from its compute and networking segment, led by sales to data centers.\n\nLet's consider why the exponential growth from Nvidia's data center business seemed to come out of nowhere, whether the business has room to run, and some headwinds investors should consider before buying this semiconductor stock.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe backbone of AI\n\nYou've probably heard a lot about how Nvidia is powering artificial intelligence (AI) but may be wondering how that actually works in practice.\n\nAs the internet has expanded, it has demanded more and more computing power. The rapid transfer of information got so intense, and data security became so vital, that localized data centers were no longer good enough. As a result, centralized data centers -- known as cloud infrastructure -- have been developed to handle massive amounts of data as efficiently and securely as possible.\n\nBut AI models demand unprecedented amounts of computational power. Companies cannot develop the AI solutions they want without the processing backbone to run those models. And that processing power is exactly what Nvidia is supplying through its data center business.\n\nNvidia's red-hot data center business\n\nNvidia's data center business is the foundation of the investment thesis and the core driver of the stock's recent gains. The company reports its results under two segments. Graphics focuses on sales for gaming, PCs, visualization, software for internet applications, and more. Compute and networking includes sales for data centers, AI for the automotive industry, electric vehicle computing platforms, and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt wasn't long ago that graphics was Nvidia's larger segment. But in fiscal 2023 (which ended Jan. 29, 2023), compute and networking overtook graphics on both revenue and operating income. Here's a look at how the dynamic has shifted over the years. The growth will astonish you.\n\nMetric Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Compute and networking revenue $3.28 billion $6.84 billion $11.05 billion $15.07 billion $47.41 billion Total revenue $10.92 billion $16.68 billion $26.91 billion $26.97 billion $60.92 billion Compute and networking share of revenue 30% 41% 39.4% 55.9% 77.8% Compute and networking operating income $750 million $2.55 billion $4.60 billion $5.08 billion $32.02 billion Segment operating income* $4.02 billion $7.16 billion $13.09 billion $9.64 billion $37.86 billion Compute and networking share of segment operating income 18.7% 35.6% 35.1% 52.7% 84.5%\n\nData source: Nvidia. *Segment operating income is the sum of compute and networking operating income and graphics operating income.

Fiscal 2024 ended Jan. 28.\n\nDuring the fiscal 2024 third-quarter earnings call, Nvidia said its HGX platform, based on its Hopper GPU architecture, had delivered the vast majority of its revenue in the quarter. The supercomputing platform can handle massive datasets and complex simulations. Nvidia has made upgrades to the offering over the years. In November, it announced the HGX H200 with configurations of up to eight GPUs. Nvidia continues to make product improvements to specifically address the AI needs of customers, and it's clearly working as Nvidia's sales are through the roof.\n\nCFO Colette Kress said during the call:\n\nNvidia HDX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on Nvidia, including Adobe, Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, Now Assist with ServiceNow, and Zoom AI Companion. Our data center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investment in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning recommender systems, and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for Nvidia accelerated computing.\n\nSince Nvidia is at the forefront of AI today, it has unique insight into the industry's trajectory, allowing it to make helpful product improvements that further sustain its growth.\n\nNot all AI investments will pan out\n\nThere's a lot of speculation about how high Nvidia can fly; some wonder if the stock is grossly overvalued. But the investment thesis is actually beautifully simple. If its customers are making money on AI, then they will demand faster and safer computing power. As the use of AI grows, so too will data centers.\n\nThe issue comes down to figuring out how much of this investment is overkill and how much will prove sticky. AI applications have to be useful and accepted by users and the marketplace. For example, if companies throw billions of dollars at their efforts to make rivals to ChatGPT, then Nvidia will benefit in the short term. But the demand for GPUs created by those efforts could prove short-lived if the returns on those AI investments fail to materialize.\n\nRight now, the greatest risk to Nvidia isn't even competition because it has the best products. Rather, it's the possibility the chip industry will become overextended, setting it up for a sharp cyclical downturn.\n\nToday, investors are buying the stock with the expectation of surging data center growth. If AI investments are here to stay, then Nvidia should be a long-term winner, even from its current valuation. But some investors may want to take a wait-and-see approach with Nvidia to gauge how its data center segment performs during a slowdown rather than judging it solely by how it's doing during the biggest cyclical upswing in the company's history.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.\n\nOur proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n\nThe SPY SPY is currently trading around our reference point of 517.39. For the bullish scenario, we aim for an initial move up to 518.04. A sustained move above 518.04 could see the price moving towards 518.76. Should the momentum continue and 519.71 holds during market hours, an advance towards 520.67 could be on the cards. The ultimate goal for a bullish day would be reaching 521.85.\n\nOn the flip side, if the SPY cannot maintain 517.39 as a support level, we anticipate a downward movement towards 516.58. A presence of sellers could push the price further down to 515.68. Breaching this level with significant selling pressure might lead us to a more substantial support at 514.62. In a scenario dominated by sellers, our lowest target for the day is set at 513.76.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1\n\nThe QQQ QQQ, also known as the Q's, is hovering around the crucial mark of 444.09. Bullish traders are eyeing a climb above 445.09. Holding above this level could set the stage for a move towards 446.51, turning it into a robust support zone. Further buying could elevate the Q's to 447.73, and if the momentum persists, we might witness a surge to 449.36. The highest bullish target for the day is 450.98.\n\nConversely, if the Q's struggle to stay above 444.09, we anticipate bearish dominance with a push down to 442.53. Observing weakness could lead to a test of 441.56, and if the selling pressure intensifies, the next level to watch would be 440.78. A break below this could see the Q's reaching the bearish target of 440.00.\n\nApple Inc.\n\nApple AAPL is currently positioned around the level of 172.95. From a bullish perspective, we're looking for the price to hold above 173.39. Achieving this could pave the way to 173.94, with further bullish actions potentially leading to 174.59. If the bulls dominate today's trading, a push towards the highest bullish target of 175.09 is anticipated.\n\nShould Apple fail to sustain the level of 172.95 as support, we foresee a potential drop to 172.45. Continued bearish momentum could lead to a decline towards 171.79, and if the selling pressure doesn't ease, the next stop could be 171.13. In a bear-dominated session, the lowest target we're looking at is 169.73.\n\nLoading...

Bulls are encouraged by the prospect of maintaining strength above this level, aiming for a rally towards 419.17, which should serve as a solid support. Sustaining above this mark could incite a move to 420.26, with the bullish momentum potentially reaching a peak at 421.62.\n\nIf Microsoft is unable to secure 417.25 as a support level, we anticipate bearish activity driving the price down to 416.32. A breach of this level might lead to further declines towards 414.56. Persistent downward pressure could bring the stock to 413.14, with the ultimate bearish target for the day positioned at 411.72.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\nNVIDIA NVDA is navigating the market at the pivotal level of 928.47. Bulls are set on driving the price up to 937.84, seeking to establish it as a firm support. An upward trajectory could see the stock reaching 945.15, with continued buying potentially leading to 950.29. The highest point bulls aim for today is 955.43.\n\nIn the event that NVIDIA cannot maintain 928.47 as a solid support through the session, bears might push the price down to 922.67. Breaking below this level with a visible selling presence could lead to a decline towards 917.98. A weaker market could further test the resolve at 913.30, with the most bearish outcome for the day being a slide to 907.51.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A\n\nAlphabet GOOGL finds itself at a trading juncture of 138.39. Bulls are hopeful of sustaining this level, aiming for an upward move to 139.46. Maintaining bullish momentum could potentially elevate the stock to the day's high target of 140.05.\n\nHowever, if Alphabet cannot find support at 138.39, we might see a downward trajectory towards 137.79. Failing to hold this could lead to further bearish tests at 136.94.

Bulls are looking to elevate the price to 176.34, with sustained buying potentially leading to a rally up to 179.79. A bullish market today could see Tesla challenging higher levels at 182.53, with the ultimate bullish target being 184.10.\n\nIf Tesla cannot hold 172.61 as a robust support, we anticipate a move down to 169.70. Further selling could bring the stock to 166.89, and if this level is compromised, a descent to the bearish target of 164.87 is expected.\n\nFinal Word: The trading session today is expected to be relatively calm data-wise. However, the 30-Year Bond Auction by the Treasury at 1PM EST might introduce notable market volatility. Market players are adjusting their strategies following the recent CPI announcement and in anticipation of upcoming PPI and unemployment figures tomorrow morning.

It became boring with all the \"AI hype.\" However, for anyone concerned with its actual AI prospects, boring Google is not. We saw many \"magnificent seven\" and other AI-related stocks skyrocketing recently. For instance, if we look back as little as eighteen months ago, here's how the magnificent seven have done since bottoming in late 2022 (from trough to peak):\n\nAlphabet: 85%\n\nApple (AAPL): 61%\n\nAmazon (AMZN): 125%\n\nMeta Platforms (META): 495%\n\nTesla (TSLA): 193%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT): 102%\n\nNvidia (NVDA): 802%\n\nAverage: 266%\n\nDespite a solid rebound off the bottom, Google's stock has lagged the other \"Mag 7\" stocks (excluding Apple). While the average magnificent seven return has been around 266%, Google's stock only appreciated by 85%. Moreover, Google's stock stumbled recently after reporting earnings on January 30th.\n\nAlphabet 1-year chart\n\nGOOG (stockcharts.com )\n\nAlphabet's recent correction brought its share price down to $132, around the 200-day MA buy-in zone. Alphabet became considerably oversold, and the selloff offered a considerable long-term buying opportunity. I increased my Alphabet position to around $140, and there is likely substantial upside ahead for Google's stock.\n\nDespite the lack of \"AI hype\" surrounding Google, it is one of the top AI stocks. Moreover, Google remains the king of search and will likely continue dominating this core segment. Finally, trading below 19 times forward EPS estimates, Google is cheap and is the cheapest Mag 7 name around. Additionally, Google has considerable revenue and EPS growth potential, making it one of the most attractive stocks to buy right now.\n\nGoogle - One Of The Top AI Stocks\n\nWhile analysts often emphasize Nvidia, Microsoft, and other companies' AI potential, Google frequently gets overlooked. Nonetheless, as the leading global search engine and Android operating system provider, Google may have more AI potential than almost anyone.\n\nGoogle Gemini is a family of AI models that can generate text and understand and operate on information such as images, audio, videos, and code. It is designed for developers to build AI-powered apps and integrate AI into their products. Google also uses Gemini to power its chatbot.\n\nThe Apple - Google Partnership\n\nApple and Google are \"in talks\" to enable Google's Gemini to power the iPhone's AI features. This is a massive development for Google and Apple as it should bring the two tech giants closer together, opening enormous opportunities for both companies. In my view, the iPhone has become dull and stale recently. However, the new AI integration in the iPhone 16 should provide users with a much different and more exciting experience.\n\nAn AI deal with Apple could expand Google's reach, leading to widespread use of its AI tools by the two billion+ iPhones Apple has in the market. Also, earlier this year, Samsung added Google-powered AI technology as Galaxy AI-branded features to its Galaxy S24 smartphones.\n\nTherefore, we see Google steadily spreading its AI tentacles throughout the smartphone kingdom, a dynamic that should translate to continued sales and EPS growth as we advance. We should also consider Google's advantage as it integrates its search and Android dominance into the equation.\n\nGoogle Remains The King Of Search\n\nDespite attempts by Microsoft Bing and other competing search engines, Google remains the unrivaled search leader globally.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3489, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec9d06d5-0001-4634-bc7e-2bdd35af7648": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec9d06d5-0001-4634-bc7e-2bdd35af7648", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/266.html", "file_name": "266.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7271, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7cf39bf-d604-4637-9b24-e2681ec8fc6a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/266.html", "file_name": "266.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7271, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a29fa7cac35264d11cb84d802f57ebd15b6754a2ce539013f4425a9af2986a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "86521552-d8e3-4679-a8ac-fa3264b63b06", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/266.html", "file_name": "266.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7271, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "dfad1d87c031b1ac71bf01a4ff45844ae63dadb8b7ce099cfbbdcfe41aed3de3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8491b666-2092-4278-95bd-455c4a23243e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "293f384ae6a93c0c428bc34554121440ef6eee6571110d6d1ea22f6c33ad4b02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e2b408fcdfef47b293e1e4261c15a63ba5dae883ba4b174cdc7ba17de36ef1ea", "text": "An AI deal with Apple could expand Google's reach, leading to widespread use of its AI tools by the two billion+ iPhones Apple has in the market.

We should also consider Google's advantage as it integrates its search and Android dominance into the equation.\n\nGoogle Remains The King Of Search\n\nDespite attempts by Microsoft Bing and other competing search engines, Google remains the unrivaled search leader globally. Google's search dominance is especially prevalent in the ultra-lucrative mobile search market.\n\nMobile search (oberlo.com)\n\nGoogle dominates mobile search with about a 95.5% share of the mobile search market. This search dynamic obliterates its competitors, with Bing only around 0.5%. Also, likely why Yandex and Baidu have any \"significant\" search share is due to Google essentially being outlawed in communist China and the totalitarian modern-day Russian regime. Google has about a 91% share in tablet search and roughly an 82% share in desktop search, respectively.\n\nGoogle's \"total search\" share is around 92% and has not dipped below 90% since 2014. Google remains on top of its search game and should continue dominating as we advance. Additionally, Google's search advantage and its leading position in AI, Android, and other areas should enable Alphabet to provide excellent results in the coming years.\n\nGoogle Stock Is Too Cheap Here\n\nGoogle's stock recently corrected by about 15%, creating an excellent long-term buying opportunity. Despite providing top and bottom line beats, Google's stock sold off unfairly, in my view. Revenue came in at $86.31 billion, a 13.5% YoY gain, and a beat of over $1B over the consensus estimate. EPS came in at $1.64, a beat of four cents, but the market expected something extraordinary. Nonetheless, Google is unlike Nvidia and many other \"hyped-up names\" it's not priced for perfection. On the contrary, Google is relatively cheap.\n\nGoogle Could Surpass Estimates\n\nEPS vs. estimates (seekingalpha.com)\n\nFirst, Google is accustomed to beating consensus estimates. Consensus EPS forecasts for 2023 were $5.46, but Google delivered $5.80 instead, an outperformance rate of over 6%. The 2024 consensus EPS is $6.79, but a similar 6% outperformance rate implies that Alphabet could achieve about $7.20 this year.\n\nAlso, applying a modest 5% outperformance rate to next year's consensus EPS figures suggests Google could earn around $8.25 in 2025. This dynamic implies that Google could be trading around 17 times forward earnings expectations, which is remarkably cheap for a company in Alphabet's advantageous position.\n\nTherefore, Google may be even cheaper than the current sub-19 forward P/E illustrates. The dual dynamic of increased EPS growth and multiple expansion may push Google's stock considerably higher as we advance.", "start_char_idx": 2765, "end_char_idx": 5866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8491b666-2092-4278-95bd-455c4a23243e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8491b666-2092-4278-95bd-455c4a23243e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/266.html", "file_name": "266.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7271, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7cf39bf-d604-4637-9b24-e2681ec8fc6a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/266.html", "file_name": "266.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7271, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a29fa7cac35264d11cb84d802f57ebd15b6754a2ce539013f4425a9af2986a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec9d06d5-0001-4634-bc7e-2bdd35af7648", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/266.html", "file_name": "266.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7271, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "e2b408fcdfef47b293e1e4261c15a63ba5dae883ba4b174cdc7ba17de36ef1ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dfe637f0-f31c-4b2f-b331-85de71e39bd0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1a0c0c76da703824b301c069edde84af9626807fa9587371a0870b8b61b5f3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "293f384ae6a93c0c428bc34554121440ef6eee6571110d6d1ea22f6c33ad4b02", "text": "The 2024 consensus EPS is $6.79, but a similar 6% outperformance rate implies that Alphabet could achieve about $7.20 this year.\n\nAlso, applying a modest 5% outperformance rate to next year's consensus EPS figures suggests Google could earn around $8.25 in 2025.

Quantifying Google's AI effect is challenging, but given the company's advantageous position in critical markets we may see more money trickle down to its bottom line than many analysts expect. This dynamic and other favorable factors make Google one of the top stocks to buy and hold for the next ten years or longer.\n\nRisks to Google\n\nDespite Google's favorable prospects, there are risks involved. Alphabet faces continuous competition in search, AI, cloud, and other crucial markets. Top companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and others continuously battle for dominance in various markets. Google needs to innovate perpetually to continue increasing its stock price. Moreover, Google faces macroeconomic and regulatory risks that could impact its sales and earnings growth in future years.

NVDA\u2019s groundbreaking announcements at GTC 2024, Goldman Sachs equity analyst Toshiya Hari provided a bullish outlook for the chipmaker giant, underscoring Nvidia\u2019s unparalleled capacity for innovation in the data center space.\n\nThe investment bank\u2019s robust confidence in Nvidia\u2019s trajectory shines through its elevated price target for NVDA shares, now set at an ambitious $1,000 \u2014 marking a notable increase from the prior $875 target.\n\nRevolutionizing Data Centers And AI: At the heart of Nvidia\u2019s announcements was the introduction of its next-generation Data Center GPU platform, dubbed Blackwell, poised to deliver a staggering up to 4x faster AI training and 30x quicker inference capabilities compared to its predecessor, the H100.\n\n\u201cWe expect Blackwell to be the fastest ramping product in Nvidia's history with Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGLGOOG, Meta Platforms Inc. META and Microsoft Corp. MSFT among others to have Blackwell-based products available starting later this year,\u201d Hari said.\n\nAlso Read: \u2018Nothing Short Of Amazing:\u2019 Nvidia Analysts Praise AI Chipmaker\u2019s GTC Unveilings, But Stock Dips As Investors Digest News\n\nExpanding Partnerships, Market Reach\n\nHari\u2019s note also highlighted Nvidia\u2019s expanding ecosystem, underscored by various partnerships across multiple sectors, including Enterprise Software, Healthcare and Automotive/Robotics. These collaborations, alongside new microservices like NIM and CUDA-X, demonstrate Nvidia\u2019s commitment to democratizing AI technology across industry verticals. Such efforts are expected to bolster Nvidia\u2019s competitive edge and deepen its market penetration.\n\n\u201cWe come away from the keynote with a renewed appreciation of Nvidia's unique ability to innovate at data center scale, large eco-system and breadth of its customer and partner engagements and, ultimately, compelling position as one of the key enablers and beneficiaries of the ongoing build-out of Generative AI infrastructure,\u201d Hari wrote.\n\nFinancial Outlook And Market Implications\n\nGoldman Sachs has revised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates for Nvidia for FY2026-27 upwards by an average of 10% and 11%, respectively. This optimism is rooted in Nvidia\u2019s robust demand and supply dynamics, its pioneering role in generative AI and the strategic introduction of products that promise higher efficiency and lower computing costs.\n\nThe acceleration of Nvidia\u2019s data center innovations not only cements its competitive edge but also presents challenges for rivals like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, which \u201cneeds to keep up with Nvidia\u2019s innovation cycle for it to maintain/extend share in the Data Center accelerator market.\u201d\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nConversely, the development bodes well for Micron Technologies Inc. MU, predicting a positive outlook for the DRAM industry given the anticipated increase in memory density with the Blackwell platform.\n\nBottom line, Goldman Sachs reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on NVDA shares with a more bullish 12-month price target of $1,000, up from $875. This adjustment reflects not only the immediate impacts of the GTC 2024 announcements but also a broader belief in Nvidia\u2019s capacity to drive and benefit from the generative AI revolution across multiple industries.\n\nRead Now: AI Boom Or YOLO Bust?

Although gold, oil, housing, and Treasury bonds have increased in value over multiple decades, no asset class has come close to replicating the average annual returns delivered by stocks over the past century.\n\nFor example, including dividends paid, the benchmark S&P 500 has delivered just a hair north of a 10% annualized return since its official inception as a 500-company index in 1957. That's a hearty return that can double investors' money about every seven years.\n\nBut on an aggregate growth basis, the S&P 500 doesn't hold a candle to what semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has done for investors since becoming a publicly traded company in 1999.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIf you purchased $1,000 of Nvidia stock at its IPO price, you're now rich\n\nNot too long before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Nvidia made its grand entrance as a publicly traded company. Its initial public offering (IPO) occurred on Jan. 22, 1999, with shares being sold at $12. Of course, a lot has changed since then.\n\nIf investors had the wherewithal to purchase $1,000 worth of Nvidia stock for its IPO, they would have received 83 shares, not including commission costs and fractional shares. In the quarter of a century since going public, this Wall Street darling has split its stock on five separate occasions. The figure in parenthesis behind each split denotes what the original 83-share position would have grown into:\n\nJune 27, 2000 : 2-for-1 stock split (166 shares)\n\nSept. 12, 2001 : 2-for-1 stock split (332 shares)\n\nApril 7, 2006 : 2-for-1 stock split (664 shares)\n\nSept. 11, 2007 : 3-for-2 stock split (996 shares)\n\nJuly 20, 2021: 4-for-1 stock split (3,984 shares)\n\nIPO-day investors have seen their share count in Nvidia grow by a factor of 48. At the same time, the IPO offering price has been reduced to a split-adjusted $0.25 per share.\n\nBased on Nvidia's closing price of $878.36 on March 15, 2024, a 3,984-share position would equate to $3,499,386. For those of you keeping score at home, Nvidia has produced a 351,244% gain since its IPO, which compares to just a 318% return for the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. Keep in mind that I'm not including the additional returns from Nvidia's nominal dividend in this 351,244% figure, either.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what's made Nvidia the stock of the century (thus far)\n\nThroughout its 25 years as a public company, Nvidia has had moments where it's thrived. For quite some time, the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used for gaming on personal computers were its calling-card to success. The company also gained momentum from 2016 through 2018 as cryptocurrency prices soared. Cryptocurrency miners gobbled up the company's high-powered GPUs.\n\nBut there's little question that Nvidia's role as the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement has done most of the heavy lifting.\n\nThough estimates vary wildly, the analysts at PwC believe AI can add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3091, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a121cecf-13cc-41c1-9807-c9fcbbca4d5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a121cecf-13cc-41c1-9807-c9fcbbca4d5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/272.html", "file_name": "272.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7678, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "383ffdeb-0c27-463c-a31d-7c74714561bc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/272.html", "file_name": "272.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7678, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "32533761b8be0f45597ef4f20b1a4059786585361c1732234460503ac22b842b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c89282c-bdcd-4b93-9714-565f23e826ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/272.html", "file_name": "272.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7678, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "b45ad80f5e8ea71fde6ab40eae0e7374724f54bc9366869160d0310a605b5daa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd519923-682f-43e3-b3f7-57daf0057773", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7447cdfef164cb4c942002e5a322249cfd48044f3ea31b7ac204618c8c88d84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e371b2c8b7ab492cce39bcc82989db3e8b82b9adf37e125b55051e2f63e0f0a8", "text": "For quite some time, the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used for gaming on personal computers were its calling-card to success.

Utilizing software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be assigned to humans, and seeing these systems evolve over time and become smarter, is what gives AI application across virtually every sector and industry.\n\nNvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of the standard in AI-accelerated data centers. With demand easily outweighing the supply of these high-powered chips, Nvidia has enjoyed otherworldly pricing power, which more than double its sales in fiscal 2024 (ended in late January).\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's ramp of A100 and H100 chips looks to be in its early innings. Its four largest customers -- and fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, have been aggressively gobbling up supply for their own AI-fueled ambitions.\n\nHowever, sustaining this success in the years to come could prove challenging.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's epic outperformance may come to a screeching halt\n\nFor the past year, Nvidia has blown the doors off of Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts. But don't expect this to continue for much longer.\n\nOne problem Nvidia may be contending with in the second-half of 2024, if not well beyond, is margin contraction. The scarcity of the company's AI-GPUs is what's lifted prices for these chips into the stratosphere. With supply chain issues beginning to ease and external competitors entering the arena, AI-focused GPUs will be far less scarce in the second-half of 2024 than they are now. That's a recipe for weaker pricing power and lower margins for Nvidia.\n\nWhat's arguably an even bigger concern for Nvidia than the external competitors that'll be challenging its AI-accelerated data center dominance is that its aforementioned top four customers, which account for 40% of its sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. Regardless of whether these internally developed GPUs are to complement Nvidia's chips or replace them, we're very likely witnessing a peak of orders that will taper into subsequent years.\n\nNvidia is also getting no help from U.S. regulators. Following an initial round of export restrictions to China for its top-notch A100 and H100 GPUs, the company developed the toned-down A800 and H800 chips. Late last year, U.S. regulators axed the shipment of these GPUs to China as well.

Shares of the AI darling are up a staggering 267% over the last 12 months and 79% year to date. Tech companies across the world covet its graphics cards like rare jewels and CEO Jensen Huang is as in-demand as some heads of state.\n\nAnd on Monday, he\u2019ll kick off Nvidia\u2019s annual GTC conference with a two-hour keynote at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., outlining what\u2019s ahead for the company in the year ahead. In prior years, Nvidia has used the show to debut some of its biggest products.\n\nIn 2022, it announced its Hopper graphics architecture and H100 graphics processing unit, which is now the go-to card for companies training and deploying AI models. This year, Nvidia is widely expected to debut Hopper and the H100\u2019s successors, kicking off what could be a new rush on the company\u2019s products.\n\nThe new architecture, codenamed Blackwell, and GPU, dubbed the B100, are anticipated to offer far better performance when it comes to running models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3. Nvidia isn\u2019t exactly hiding its plans for the B100. During the Supercomputer 2023 conference, the company showed off a slide outlining the GPU\u2019s potential capabilities compared to the H100 and H200 cards.\n\nIn addition to the Blackwell architecture and B100 card, Nvidia will also likely give attendees and viewers a look at the latest advancements in its CUDA software.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage at GTC 2024 on March 18 in San Jose. (Ross D. Franklin/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe platform, which lets programmers take advantage of a GPU\u2019s processing capabilities for AI and other applications, is an essential part of Nvidia\u2019s overall enterprise strategy and helps lock in developers who build on Nvidia\u2019s software, virtually ensuring they\u2019ll stick with Nvidia\u2019s products in the future.\n\nNvidia could also announce that it will begin producing its H20 AI chip for the Chinese market. The chip, according to Reuters, is meant to serve as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s more powerful H100 and H200 chips. The US prohibits Nvidia from selling those chips to Chinese customers for fear that the Chinese military and government will use them to develop advanced AI applications to rival the US's.\n\nThose are the big stories we\u2019ll be watching from GTC, but we\u2019ll also likely get plenty of other announcements and debuts from Nvidia and its partners.\n\nSome 300 exhibitors are set to take part in the conference and speakers ranging from OpenAI\u2019s COO Brad Lightcap and Meta\u2019s vice president of AI research Joelle Pineau to Microsoft\u2019s vice president of generative AI S\u00e9bastien Bubeck set to make appearances at the show.\n\nYahoo Finance will be on the ground, bringing you all of the biggest news from the conference and chatting with some of Nvidia\u2019s top executives.

Stock futures are lower ahead of the Fed meeting and bitcoin (BTCUSD) is extending its retreat, now down to around $63,000. Here\u2019s what investors need to know today.\n\n1. Bank of Japan Ends Era of Negative Interest Rates\n\nThe Bank of Japan became the last major central bank to abandon its negative interest rate policy Tuesday, saying a new era of stable inflation is in sight for the country. The BOJ moved its key target for short-term interest rates to a range of 0% to 0.1%, its first rate increase since 2007. Japan is the single largest overseas holder of U.S. Treasurys, and higher interest rates typically buoy the yen, which makes the country's exports more expensive. Still, there\u2019s unlikely to be a mass exodus by Japanese investors into domestic government bonds, given how wide the differentials are with the U.S.; the Japanese 10-year yield is at around 0.7% while Treasury yields are at around 4.3%.\n\n\n\n2. Federal Reserve Kicks Off Policy Meeting\n\nThe Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy meeting Tuesday, with investors focused on what officials will say about when and how much the central bank will cut interest rates, especially with recent inflation numbers being hotter than expected. Fed officials have said they are waiting for \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that inflation is firmly on its way back down to the central bank\u2019s goal of 2% before they lower the rate. The Fed is set to keep its benchmark interest-rate target unchanged this week, however. The rate is crucial for Americans as it influences mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, and other kinds of loans\u2014all of which now have borrowing costs close to multi-decade highs.\n\n\n\n3. Unilever Rises on Plan to Spin Off Ice Cream Unit, Including Ben & Jerry\u2019s\n\nShares of Unilever Plc (UL) are up about 3% in premarket trading after the consumer products giant announced plans to separate Ben & Jerry\u2019s and its other ice cream brands such as Magnum into a stand-alone business as part of a restructuring that could affect around 7,500 jobs. The London-based maker of Dove soap and Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise said the jobs affected would be \u201cpredominantly office-based roles globally.\u201d The consumer-goods giant said Tuesday the restructuring would begin immediately and is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, delivering total cost savings of about 800 million euros ($868.3 million.)\n\n\n\n4.

ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer app in history, reaching 100 million monthly active users just two months after its launch, and the new app has made it clear that we're in a new era of technology -- the age of AI.\n\nFor investors, it's no secret that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest winners in the generative AI boom. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and other chips have experienced skyrocketing demand because those products are especially well suited to make demanding applications like ChatGPT run, and ChatGPT's own success has showcased the power of Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nBuying Nvidia stock when ChatGPT was first launched would have been a genius move, but before I answer the question of how much the stock has returned since then, let's take a look at why Nvidia has been such a big winner from the AI boom.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy Nvidia is leading the AI boom\n\nNvidia invented GPUs in 1999, and the company has been the leader in that category since then. GPUs are well suited for gaming, one of Nvidia's historical strengths, and those chips have also excelled at applications like cryptocurrency mining and autonomous driving. Now, artificial intelligence is having its turn.\n\nCompared to central processing units (CPUs), GPUs perform technical calculations faster and more efficiently, which means they deliver better performance for AI training and inference, as well as other applications that use accelerated computing -- a faster way of processing workloads and what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang describes as the future of data-center infrastructure.\n\nConsequently, AI models have been trained on GPUs, and GPU technology has improved exponentially since its early years. According to Stanford's Human-Centered AI group, GPU performance \"has increased roughly 7,000 times\" since 2003, and the chips should continue to get better. GPUs are also more cost-effective than alternatives like CPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on the MLPerf, an industry-standard benchmark for AI, Nvidia's GPUs have been the best in training and inference since the test was launched in 2019, which helps explain why Nvidia has a virtual monopoly in the category.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is the only other major GPU maker, but Nvidia still dominates the market with an estimated 98% share of the data-center GPU category. While competition is coming, including AMD's new Mi300 and Intel's Gaudi3 accelerator, both of which recently launched, it won't be easy to unseat Nvidia's dominance in AI GPUs. That explains why the company is now worth more than $2 trillion, and the stock is still testing all-time highs more than a year after ChatGPT was launched.\n\nNvidia's post-ChatGPT surge\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched on Nov. 30, 2022, Nvidia stock actually jumped, gaining 8.2% to close at $169.15 that day.

The stock surged in May after it blew away Wall Street with guidance calling for revenue to triple. This year, Nvidia has soared again on signs that Wall Street is still underestimating AI demand and as Nvidia enters new markets like PC chips.\n\nIs it still safe to buy Nvidia?\n\nWhat's also noteworthy about the stock's surge following ChatGPT's launch is that its valuation has actually shrunk during that time, as measured by the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, because profits have rocketed higher as it capitalized on AI demand.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThat's a sign that buying Nvidia isn't as risky at it might seem after a run-up that's added more than $1.5 trillion in market value in less than 16 months and made it the third-most-valuable company in the world after Microsoft and Apple.\n\nInvestors should expect Nvidia stock to remain volatile along with the rest of the AI sector, but concerns about a potential bubble seem overblown.

Both stocks are up over 240% over the past year and have fierce loyalty among investors.\n\nIs one artificial intelligence (AI) stock better than the other? To find out, I compared them head-to-head to see why they're thriving and whether they can continue. It was a very close race, but one stood out just ahead of the other.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nMeeting these two very different companies\n\nBoth stocks soared due to the fantastic performance of their underlying businesses. However, these two AI companies are very different. Nvidia spent years specializing in high-performance GPUs, which became ideal for data centers and AI. Nvidia's high-quality products and CUDA software, which helps customers efficiently use their GPUs power, have led to Nvidia grabbing an early stranglehold on the AI chip market -- an estimated 80% to 90%.\n\nOn the other hand, Palantir builds custom software applications for both government and commercial applications. It runs three software platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and AIP for AI applications. You can think of Palantir as an operating system that helps organizations use their data. The company's intent is that it augments human intelligence; it doesn't replace it.\n\nA closer look at each company's growth\n\nFrom a pure numbers standpoint, Nvidia is growing leaps and bounds faster than Palantir. You can see below how both companies began accelerating revenue growth in mid-2023, but Nvidia soared on massive data center spending from big technology customers, mainly in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" It could be fair to wonder how long this enormous boost in data center spending from big tech will continue.\n\nOne possibility is that these companies start producing custom chips in-house, weaning themselves off of Nvidia's. That could hurt long-term growth for a company currently getting most of its revenue from a small handful of customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nSpeaking of Palantir, the company is not as explosive as Nvidia. But what impresses me is the company's expanding customer base. Palantir's U.S. customer count grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% quarter over quarter. Customers come in all shapes and sizes, so it's not a precise translation. Such customer growth bodes well for long-term revenue growth.\n\nMaybe Nvidia's customer concentration won't matter, and Nvidia's chips will maintain their market share. Still, I'd like to see customer expansion like Palantir's.\n\nWhat's the better bang for your buck?\n\nAnalysts expect significant earnings growth from both companies moving forward. On a forward basis, that makes both stocks cheaper than you would guess after both of their 200% runs. I like using the PEG ratio to compare how much I pay for a company's earnings growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the better, and I would like to spend under 1.5 if I can.\n\nNvidia fits that criteria with a PEG ratio of just over 1. Palantir doesn't quite fit, with its PEG ratio of 1.6.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNvidia is handily the better value today, based on each company's expected long-term earnings growth. Of course, the caveat is whether each company will perform up to expectations.\n\nThe verdict is...\n\nBoth companies are excellent AI stocks and leaders in their respective areas. Both are accelerating their revenue growth. Naturally, analysts are very optimistic about each company's earnings growth moving forward. Whichever company you believe is more likely to meet growth expectations over the next three to five years is probably your winner.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3711, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7846af04-6394-4462-b270-9bc26b6a5a9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7846af04-6394-4462-b270-9bc26b6a5a9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/288.html", "file_name": "288.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5285, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bab5d1cd-efca-43ed-bad2-8575c2244fac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/288.html", "file_name": "288.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5285, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "02aca07bbc8d7aa2d36eeaed0097449fe7d8039e6d08703c38163292362f5863", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d990213-a0bd-469a-b413-3e382d552bda", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/288.html", "file_name": "288.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5285, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "8f7a45718a6bc38016692f61020a9950f82eba30042e6df010abeedf87fedaa2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e17a1e7b-b6aa-4312-8268-43dd15ee18a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b976726a0420918c29d2c85c8b9fe94e8c8de2bdee8bbe1bd30ada962c78a64f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1fdd4bd71f5609ce9a33cafe66b89400465463337d28952e1a7460be505c05df", "text": "Nvidia fits that criteria with a PEG ratio of just over 1.

Why?\n\nPalantir gets roughly half its revenue from government contracts.

There were so many things I wanted to say yesterday and probably have said -- and wanted to say better, but I got to tell you, I've never presented at a rock concert before. I don't know about you guys, but I've never presented in a rock concert before. The -- I had simulated what it was going to be like, but when I walked on stage, it still took my breath away. And so anyways, I did the best I could.\n\nNext, after the tour, I'm going to do a better job, I'm sure. I just need a lot more practice. But there were a few things I wanted to tell you. Is there a clicker -- oh, look at that. See, this is like spatial computing. It's -- by the way, if you get -- I don't know you'll get a chance, because it takes a little step up, but if you get a chance to see Omniverse in Vision Pro, it is insane. Completely incomprehensible how realistic it is.\n\nAll right. So we spoke about five things yesterday and I think the first one really deserves some explanation. I think the first one is, of course, this new industrial revolution. There were two -- there are two things that are happening, two transitions that are happening. The first is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. If you just looked at the extraordinary trend of general-purpose computing, it has slowed down tremendously over the years.\n\nAnd in fact, we've known that it's been slowing down for about a decade and people just didn't want to deal with it for a decade, but you really have to deal with it now. And you can see that people are extending the depreciation cycle of their data centers as a result. You could buy a whole new set of general purpose servers and it's not going to improve your throughput of your overall data center dramatically.\n\nAnd so you might as well just continue to use what you have for a little longer.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3481, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5248781-7016-4952-a1ae-3b9e6d028ebe": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5248781-7016-4952-a1ae-3b9e6d028ebe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e17a1e7b-b6aa-4312-8268-43dd15ee18a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "b976726a0420918c29d2c85c8b9fe94e8c8de2bdee8bbe1bd30ada962c78a64f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "58a0b783-125e-4b84-9dd3-7b85e3d87bb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73aaabb8ec366661c05b29486f112c5318a157280a2f0880a42229f9be2e3e90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e21dfae5f517a579ffa66bd1171573b56d7a1a3657040c5b02cf35686e3b7477", "text": "There were two -- there are two things that are happening, two transitions that are happening. The first is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. If you just looked at the extraordinary trend of general-purpose computing, it has slowed down tremendously over the years.\n\nAnd in fact, we've known that it's been slowing down for about a decade and people just didn't want to deal with it for a decade, but you really have to deal with it now. And you can see that people are extending the depreciation cycle of their data centers as a result. You could buy a whole new set of general purpose servers and it's not going to improve your throughput of your overall data center dramatically.\n\nAnd so you might as well just continue to use what you have for a little longer. That trend is never going to reverse. General purpose computing has reached this end. We're going to continue to need it and there's a whole lot of software that runs on it, but it is very clear we should accelerate everything we can.\n\nThere are many different industries that have already been accelerated, some that are very large workloads that we really would like to accelerate more. But the benefits of accelerated computing is very, very clear.\n\nOne of the areas that I didn't spend time on yesterday that I really wanted to was data processing. NVIDIA has a suite of libraries that before you could do almost anything in a company, you have to process the data. You have to, of course, ingest the data, and the amount of data is extraordinary. Zettabytes of data being created around the world, just doubling every couple of years, even though computing is not doubling every couple of years.\n\nSo you know that data processing, you're on the wrong side of that curve already on data processing. If you don't move to accelerated computing, your data processing bills just keep on going up and up and up and up. And so for a lot of companies that recognize this, AstraZeneca, Visa, Amex, Mastercard, so many, so many companies that we work with, they've reduced their data processing expense by 95%, basically 20 times reduction.\n\nTo the point the acceleration is so extraordinary now with our suite of libraries called rapids, that the inventor of Spark, who started a great company called Databricks, and they are the cloud large scale data processing company, they announced that they're going to take Databricks their photon engine, which is their crown jewel and they're going to accelerate that with NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nOkay. So the benefit of acceleration, of course, pass along savings to your customers, but very importantly, so that you can continue to sustainably compute. Otherwise, you're on the wrong side of that curve. You'll never get on the right side of the curve. You have to accelerate. The question is today or tomorrow? Okay. So accelerated computing. We accelerated algorithms so quickly that the marginal cost of computing has declined so tremendously over the last decade that it enabled this new way of doing software called generative AI.\n\nGenerative AI, as you know, requires a lot of flops, a lot of flops, a lot of computation. It is not a normal amount of computation, an insane amount of computation. And yet it can now be done cost effectively that consumers can use this incredible service called ChatGPT. So, it's something to consider that accelerated computing has dropped, has driven down the marginal cost of computing so far that enabled a new way of doing something else.\n\nAnd this new way is software written by computers with a raw material called data. You apply energy to it. There's an instrument called GPU supercomputers. And what comes out of it are tokens that we enjoy. When you're interacting with ChatGPT, you're getting all -- it's producing tokens.\n\nNow, that data center is not a normal data center. It's not a data center that you know of in the past. The reason for that is this.

The reason for that is this. It's not shared by a whole lot of people. It's not doing a whole lot of different things. It's running one application 24/7. And its job is not just to save money, its job is to make money. It's a factory.\n\nThis is no different than an AC generator of the last industrial revolution. And it's no different than the raw material coming in is, of course, water. They applied energy to it and turns into electricity. Now it's data that comes into it. It's refined using data processing, and then, of course, generative AI models.\n\nAnd what comes out of it is valuable tokens. This idea that we would apply this basic method of software, token generation, what some people call inference, but token generation. This method of producing software, producing data, interacting with you, ChatGPT is interacting with you.\n\nThis method of working with you, collaborating with you, you extend this as far as you like, copilots to artificial intelligence agents, you extend the idea as long as you like, but it's basically the same idea. It's generating software, it's generating tokens and it's coming out of this thing called an AI generator that we call GPU supercomputers. Does that make sense?\n\nAnd so the two ideas. One is the traditional data centers that we use today should be accelerated and they are. They're being modernized, lots and lots of it, and more and more industries one after another. And so what is a trillion dollars of data centers in the world will surely all be accelerated someday. The question is, how many years would it take to do? But because of the second dynamic, which is its incredible benefit in artificial intelligence, it's going to further accelerate that trend. Does that make sense?\n\nHowever, the second data center, the second type of data center called AC generators or excuse me, AI generators or AI factories, as I've described it as, this is a brand new thing. It's a brand new type of software generating a brand new type of valuable resource and it's going to be created by companies, by industries, by countries, so on and so forth, a new industry.\n\nI also spoke about our new platform. People are -- there are a lot of speculations about Blackwell. Blackwell is both a chip at the heart of the system, but it's really a platform. It's basically a computer system. What NVIDIA does for a living is not build the chip. We build an entire supercomputer, from the chip to the system to the interconnects, the NVLinks, the networking, but very importantly the software.\n\nCould you imagine the mountain of electronics that are brought into your house, how are you going to program it? Without all of the libraries that were created over the years in order to make it effective, you've got a couple of billion dollars' worth of asset you just brought into your company.\n\nAnd anytime it's not utilized is costing you money. And the expense is too incredible. And so our ability to help companies not just buy the chips, but to bring up the systems and put it to use and then working with them all the time to make it -- put it to better and better and better use, that is really important.\n\nOkay.", "start_char_idx": 5916, "end_char_idx": 9748, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff1e553f-8f39-4711-b37a-a74804c9a068": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff1e553f-8f39-4711-b37a-a74804c9a068", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "58a0b783-125e-4b84-9dd3-7b85e3d87bb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "73aaabb8ec366661c05b29486f112c5318a157280a2f0880a42229f9be2e3e90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "65ea06e4-17c4-4763-a4ef-ef4f9e3e7a8d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d90b22c1290ba71177b494a261aa6290ebafd03c9c82e7cd0ba0a8c9dceb229", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "50a8ea03c924d1a9aa8013793e11fb9627dd6058e4cae65ec6e064a52020d4a4", "text": "We build an entire supercomputer, from the chip to the system to the interconnects, the NVLinks, the networking, but very importantly the software.\n\nCould you imagine the mountain of electronics that are brought into your house, how are you going to program it?

That's what NVIDIA does for a living. The platform we call Blackwell has all of these components associated with it that I showed you at the end of the presentation to give you a sense of the magnitude of what we've built. All of that, we then disassemble. This is the hard -- this is the part that's incredibly hard about what we do.\n\nWe build this vertically integrated thing, but we build it in a way that can be disassembled later and for you to buy it in parts, because maybe you want to connect it to x86. Maybe you want to connect it to a PCI-Express fabric. Maybe you want to connect it across a whole bunch of fiber, okay, optics.\n\nMaybe you want to have very large NVLink domains. Maybe you want smaller NVLink domains. Maybe you can use arm, maybe so on and so forth. Does it make sense? Maybe you would like to use Ethernet. Okay, Ethernet is not great for AI. It doesn't matter what anybody says.\n\nYou can't change the facts. And there's a reason for that. There's a reason why Ethernet is not great for AI. But you can make Ethernet great for AI. In the case of the ethernet industry, it's called Ultra Ethernet. So in about three or four years, Ultra Ethernet is going to come, it'll be better for AI. But until then, it's not good for AI. It's a good network, but it's not good for AI. And so we've extended Ethernet, we've added something to it. We call it Spectrum-X that basically does adaptive routing. It does congestion control. It does noise isolation.\n\nRemember, when you have chatty neighbors, it takes away from the network traffic. And AI, AI is not about the average throughput. AI is not about the average throughput of the network, which is what Ethernet is designed for, maximum average throughput. AI only cares about when did the last student turn in their partial product? It's the last person. A fundamentally different design point. If you're optimizing for highest average versus the worst student, you will come up with a different architecture. Does it make sense?\n\nOkay. And because AI has all reduce all to all, all gather, just look it up in the algorithm, the transformer algorithm, the mixture of experts algorithm, you'll see all of it. All these GPUs all have to communicate with each other and the last GPU to submit the answer holds everybody back. That's how it works. And so that's the reason why the networking is such a large impact.\n\nCan you network everything together? Yes. But will you lose 10%, 20% of utilization? Yes. And what's 10% to 20% utilization if the computer is $10,000? Not much. But what's 10% to 20% utilization if the computer is $2 billion? It paid for the whole network, which is the reason why supercomputers are paid -- are built the way they are.

It paid for the whole network, which is the reason why supercomputers are paid -- are built the way they are. Okay.\n\nAnd so anyways, I showed examples of all these different components and our company creates a platform and all the software associated with it, all the necessary electronics, and then we work with companies and customers to integrate that into their data center, because maybe their security is different, maybe their thermal management is different, maybe their management plane is different, maybe they want to use it just for one dedicated AI, maybe they want to rent it out for a lot of people to do different AI with.\n\nThe use cases are so broad. And maybe they want to build an on-prem and they want to run VMware on it. And maybe somebody just wants to run Kubernetes, somebody wants to run Slurm. Well, I could list off all of the different varieties of environments and it is completely mind blowing.\n\nAnd we took all of those considerations and over the course of quite a long time, we've now figured out how to serve literally everybody. As a result, we could build supercomputers at scale. But basically what NVIDIA does is build data centers. Okay. We break it up into small parts and we sell it as components. People think as a result, we're a chip company.\n\nThe third thing that we did was we talked about this new type of software called NIMs. These large language models are miracles. ChatGPT is a miracle. It's a miracle not just in what it's able to do, but the team that put it so that you can interact with ChatGPT in very high response rate. That is a world class computer science organization. That is not a normal computer science organization.\n\nThe OpenAI team that's working on this stuff is world class, is a world class team, some of the best in the world. Well, in order for every company to be able to build their own AI, operate their own AI, deploy their own AI, run it across multiple clouds, somebody is going to have to go do that computer science for them. And so instead of doing this for every single model, for every single company, every single configuration, we decided to create the tools and tooling and the operations and we're going to package up large language models for the very first time.\n\nAnd you could buy it. You could just come to our website, download it and you can run it. And the way we charge you is all of those models are free. But when you run it, when you deploy it in an enterprise, the cost of running it is $4,500 per GPU per year. Basically, the operating system of running that language model.\n\nOkay. And so the per instance, the per-use cost is extremely low. It's very, very affordable. And -- but the benefit is really great. Okay. We call that NIMs, NVIDIA Inference Microservices. You take these NIMs and you're going to have NIMs of all kinds. You're going to have NIMs of computer vision.

And -- but the benefit is really great. Okay. We call that NIMs, NVIDIA Inference Microservices. You take these NIMs and you're going to have NIMs of all kinds. You're going to have NIMs of computer vision. You're going to have NIMs of speech and speech recognition and text to speech and you're going to have facial animation. You're going to have robotic articulation. You're going to have all kinds of different types of NIMs.\n\nThese NIMs, the way that you would use it is you would download it from our website and you would fine tune it with your examples. You would give it examples. You say the way that you responded to that question isn't exactly right. It might be right in another company, but it's not right in ours. And so I'm going to give you some examples that are exactly the way we would like to have it. You show it your work products. This is the way -- this is what a good answer looks like. This is what right answer looks like, whole bunch of them.\n\nAnd we have a system that helps you curate that process that tokenize that, all of the AI processing that goes along with it, all the data processing that goes along with it, fine tuning that, evaluate that, guardrail that so that your AIs are very effective, number one, also very narrow.\n\nAnd the reason why you want it to be very narrow is because if you're a retail company, you would prefer your AI just didn't pontificate about some random stuff, okay. And so whatever the questions are, it guardrails it back to that lane. And so that guard railing system is another AI. So, we have all these different AIs that help you customize our NIMs and you could create all kinds of different NIMs.\n\nAnd we gave you some frameworks for many of them. And one of the very important ones is understanding proprietary data, because every company has proprietary data. And so we created a microservice called Retriever. It's state-of-the-art and it helps you take your database, which is structured or unstructured images or graphs or charts or whatever it is and we help you embed them.\n\nWe help you extract the meaning out of that data. And then we take the -- it's called semantics and what that semantic is embedded in a vector that vector is now indexed into a new database called vector database, okay. And that vector database, then afterwards you can just talk to it. You say, hey, how many mammals do I have, for example. And it goes in there and says, hey, look at that. You got a cat, you have a dog, you have a giraffe.\n\nThis is what you have in inventory, in your warehouse you have, okay, so on and so forth, all right. And so all of that is called NeMo and we have experts to help you. And then we put our -- we put a canonical NVIDIA infrastructure we call DGX Cloud in all of the world's clouds. And so we have DGX Cloud in AWS, we have DGX Cloud in Azure, we have DGX Cloud in GCP and OCI.\n\nAnd so we work with the world's enterprise companies, particularly the enterprise IT companies and we create these great AIs with them, but when they're done, they can run in DGX Cloud, which means we're effectively bringing customers to the world's clouds. A platform like us, a platform company, brings system makers customers and CSPs are system makers.\n\nThey rent systems instead of sell systems, but they're system makers. And so we bring customers to our CSPs, which is a very sensible thing to do just as we brought customers to HP and Dell and IBM and Lenovo and so on and so forth and Supermicro and CoreWeave, so on and so forth, we bring customers to CSPs because a platform company does that.

Does that make sense?\n\nIf you're a platform company, you create opportunities for everybody in your ecosystem. And so the DGX Cloud allows us to land all of these enterprise applications in the world CSPs. And they want to do it on-prem. We have great partnerships with Dell that we announced yesterday, HP and others, that you can land those NIMs in their systems.\n\nAnd then I talked about the next wave of AI, which is really about industrial AI. This -- that the vast majority of the world's industries, the largest in dollars, are heavy industries and heavy industries have never really benefited from IT. They've not benefited from a lot of the design and all of the digital.\n\nIt's called not digitization, but digitalization, putting it to use. They've not benefited from digitalization, not like our industry. And because our industry is completely digitalized, our technology advance is insanely great. We don't call it chip discovery. We call it chip design. Why do they call it drug discovery, like, tomorrow could be different than yesterday? Because it is.\n\nAnd it's so much -- it's so complicated -- it's so complicated biology, it's so changed -- and the longitudinal impact is so great, because, as you know, life evolves at a different rate than transistors. And so therefore, cause and effect is harder to monitor because it happens over a large scale, large scale of systems and large scale of time. These are very complicated problems. Physics is very similar.\n\nOkay. Industrial physics is very similar. And so we finally have the ability using large language models, the same technologies. If we can tokenize proteins, if we could tokenize -- if we can tokenize words, tokenize speech, tokenize images, we can tokenize articulation. This is no different than speech, right?\n\nWe can tokenize proteins moving, that's no different than speech, okay. Just -- we can tokenize all these different things. We can tokenize physics then we can understand its meaning just like we've understood the meaning of words.\n\nIf we can understand its meaning and we can connect it to other modalities then we can do generative AI. So I just explained very quickly that 12 years ago I saw it, our company saw it with ImageNet. The big breakthrough was literally 12 years ago.\n\nWe said, interesting, but what are we actually looking at? Interesting, but what are you looking at? ChatGPT, I would say, everybody should say interesting, but what are we looking at? What are we looking at? We are looking at a computer software that can emulate you -- emulate us.\n\nBy reading our words, it's emulating the production of our words. Why -- if you can tokenize words and if you could tokenize articulation, for example, why can't it imitate us and generalize it in a way that ChatGPT has. So the ChatGPT moment for robotics has got to be around the corner. And so we want to enable people to be able to do that. And so we created this operating system that enables these AIs to be able to practice in a physically based world and we call it Omniverse.\n\nOmniverse is not a tool. Omniverse is not even an engine. Omniverse are APIs, technology APIs that supercharge other people's tools. And so I'm super excited about the announcement with Dassault. They're using -- they're connecting to Omniverse API to supercharge 3DEXCITE.", "start_char_idx": 18170, "end_char_idx": 21937, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a34711d-1328-49c4-b3e0-61bd36ae6779": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a34711d-1328-49c4-b3e0-61bd36ae6779", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "17e4a4c5-5d48-4380-a6b3-5c853b735cd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "efa6126e39aa98c4dbe49d8106468a7555cd5f02ef48138a3ae01a8582cc162c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "536c3769-7e6a-4464-b325-63a7b5278970", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba5f1ee8fef3d531d6a3caeb0684bd7b01bc3221b75f736938b7e2b9c2c731bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "06ec2699ed787301e4960dc98c5610d0b3c5bcbaf23d3618d7e86ae8b2fb0025", "text": "Why -- if you can tokenize words and if you could tokenize articulation, for example, why can't it imitate us and generalize it in a way that ChatGPT has.

They're using -- they're connecting to Omniverse API to supercharge 3DEXCITE. Microsoft is connected it to Power BI.\n\nRockwell has connected it to their tools for industrial automation. Siemens has connected to their, so it's a bunch of APIs that is physically based and it produces image or articulation and it connects a whole bunch of different environments. And so these APIs are intended to supercharge third party tools. And I'm super delighted to see the adoption across it, particularly in industrial automation. And so those are the five things that we did.\n\nI'll do this next one very quickly. I'm sorry I took longer than I should, but let me do this next one really quickly. Look at that. All right. So this chart, don't over stare at it, but it's basically, it communicates several things. On top are developers. NVIDIA is a market maker, not share taker. The reason for that is everything we do doesn't exist when we started doing it. There is no such -- you just go up and down. In fact, even in originally 3D computer games didn't exist when we started working on it.\n\nAnd so we had to go create the algorithms necessary. Real time ray tracing did not exist until we created it. And so all of these different capabilities did not exist until we created it. And once we created it, there are no applications for it. So we had to go cultivate and work with developers to integrate this technology we have just created so that applications could be benefited by it.\n\nI just explained that for Omniverse. We invented Omniverse. We didn't take anything from anybody, didn't exist. And in order for it to be useful, we now have to have developers, Dassault, Ansys, Cadence, so on and so forth. Does that make sense? Rockwell, Siemens.\n\nWe need the developers to take advantage of our APIs, our technologies. Sometimes they're in the form of an SDK. In the case of Omniverse, I'm super proud that it's in the form of cloud APIs, because now it's so easy to use that you could use it in both ways, but APIs are much, much easier to use, okay. And we host Omniverse in the Azure cloud. And notice whenever we connect it to a customer, we create an opportunity for Azure.\n\nSo Azure is on the foundation, their system provider. Back in the old days, system providers used to be OEMs and they continue to be, but system providers on the bottom, developers on top. We invent technology in the middle. The technology that we invent happens to be chip last.\n\nIt's software first. And the reason for that is without a developer, there will be no demand for chips. And so NVIDIA is an algorithm company first and we create these SDKs. They call them DSLs, domain specific libraries. SQL is a domain specific library. You might have heard of Hadoop is a domain specific library in storage computing.\n\nNVIDIA's cuDNN is potentially the most successful domain specific library short of SQL the world has ever seen. cuDNN is the domain specific library. It's computation engine library for deep neural networks. Without DNN, none of them would have been able to use CUDA. So DNN was invented.", "start_char_idx": 21245, "end_char_idx": 24947, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "536c3769-7e6a-4464-b325-63a7b5278970": {"__data__": {"id_": "536c3769-7e6a-4464-b325-63a7b5278970", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a34711d-1328-49c4-b3e0-61bd36ae6779", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "06ec2699ed787301e4960dc98c5610d0b3c5bcbaf23d3618d7e86ae8b2fb0025", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b6d6f8a9-ad98-4be3-93ee-2a253ed1589e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "691320ead30cfa5783d24fc6af425f09f6e9f5a6089a4ed0d3950428b07666b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ba5f1ee8fef3d531d6a3caeb0684bd7b01bc3221b75f736938b7e2b9c2c731bd", "text": "We invent technology in the middle.

It's computation engine library for deep neural networks. Without DNN, none of them would have been able to use CUDA. So DNN was invented.\n\nReal time ray tracing optics, which led to RTX, makes sense. And we have hundreds of domain specific libraries. Omniverse is a domain specific library. And these domain specific libraries are integrated with developers on the software side, which then when the applications are created and there's demand for that application, creates opportunities for the foundation below. We are market makers, not share takers. Does that make sense?\n\nAnd so what's the takeaway? The takeaway is you can't create markets without software. It has always been the case. That has never changed. You could build chips to make software run better, but you can't create a new market without software. What makes NVIDIA unique is that we're the only chip company I believe that can go create its own market and notice all the markets we're creating.\n\nThat's why we're always talking about the future. These are things that we're working on. We really -- nothing would give me more joy to work with the entire industry to create the computer aided drug design industry, not drug discovery industry, drug design industry.\n\nWe had to do drug designed the way we do drug chip design not chip discovery. And so I expect every single chip next year to be better than the one before, not as if I'm looking for truffles, which is discovery. Some days are good, some days are less good.\n\nOkay, all right. So we have developers on top. We have our foundation on the bottom. The developers want something very, very simple. They want to make sure that your technology is performing, but they have to solve the problem, that they couldn't solve any other way. But the most important thing for a developer is installed base. And the reason for that is they don't sell hardware, their software doesn't get used if nobody has the hardware to run it.\n\nOkay. So what developers want is installed base that has not changed since the beginning of time, is has not changed now. Artificial intelligence, if you develop artificial intelligence software and you want to deploy so that people could use it, you need installed base.\n\nSecond, the systems companies, the foundation companies they want killer apps. That's the way -- that's the reason why killer app word existed because where there is a killer app, there is customer demand, where there is customer demand, you can sell hardware.\n\nAnd so, it turns out this loop is insanely hard to kick-start. And how many accelerated computing platforms can you really, really build? Can you have an accelerated computing platform for generative AI as well as industrial robotics, as well as quantum as well as 6G as well as weather prediction as well.\n\nAnd you can have all these different versions because some of it is good at fluids. Some of it's good at particle. Some of it is good at biology. Some of it is good at robotics. Some of it is good at AI. Some of it is good at SQL. The answer is no. You need a general -- sufficiently general purpose accelerated computing platform.

Some of it's good at particle. Some of it is good at biology. Some of it is good at robotics. Some of it is good at AI. Some of it is good at SQL. The answer is no. You need a general -- sufficiently general purpose accelerated computing platform. Just as the last computing platform was insanely successful because they ran everything.\n\nNow NVIDIA is taken us a long time, but we basically run everything. If your software is accelerated, I am very certain, it runs on NVIDIA. Does that makes sense? Okay. If you have accelerated software, I am very, very certain it runs on NVIDIA. And the reason for that is because it probably ran on NVIDIA first.\n\nOkay. All right. So this is the NVIDIA architecture. I spoke about whenever I give keynotes, I tend to touch on all of them, different pieces of it, something that -- some new things that we did in the middle, in this case, Blackwell. I spoke about there were so many good stuff and you really have to go to our tox, looks like a 1000 tox. 6G research, how 6G going to happen? Of course, AI. And why do you use the AI for? Robotic MIMO.\n\nWhy is MIMO so pre-installed meaning that, why does the algorithm come before the site. We should have site-specific MIMO just like Robotic MIMO. And so, reinforcement learning and the deals with the environment and so 6G of course is going to be software-defined, of course, it's going to be AI.\n\nQuantum Computing, of course, we should be a great partner for the quantum computing industry. How else are you going to drive a Quantum Computer? To have the world's fastest computer sitting next to it.\n\nAnd how are you going to stimulate a Quantum Computer, emulate the Quantum Computer? What is the programming model for Quantum Computer? You can't just program a Quantum Computer all by itself. You need to have classical computing sitting next to it. And sort of quantum would be kind of a quantum accelerator.\n\nAnd so that -- who should go do that, well we've done that and so we work with all the industry on that. So across the board, some really, really great stuff. I wish I could have covered, we could have a whole keynote just on all that stuff. But we cover the whole gamut. Okay. So that was kind of yesterday. Thank you for that.\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nA - Colette Kress\n\nOkay. We have them going around and we'll see if we can grab your questions.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThat was the question that I'm sure, first question goes.

How do you look at -- if we look in 10 years are you -- and you're not a chip company, but what do you think, you look like given what you're seeing with the momentum in software and how you're building these industries. It would seem like you're going to be a lot more.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYeah. Thank you, Ben. I appreciate that. First of all, I appreciate all of you coming. This is a very, very different type of event as you know. Most of the talks are software talks, and they're all computer scientists, and they're talking about algorithms. What NVIDIA -- the NVIDIA software stack is about two things. It's either algorithms that help the computer run better, TensorRT-LLM. It's an insanely complicated algorithm, and it explores the computing space in a way that most compilers never have to do. And TensorRT-LLM can't even be built without a supercomputer. And it's very likely that TensorRT in the future, TensorRT-LLM in the future, actually just have to run on a supercomputer all the time and in order to optimize AIs for everybody's computer. And so that optimization problem is very, very complicated. So that would be an example of software that we create, the optimization, the runtime. The second software we create is whenever there's an algorithm where the principled algorithm is well known. For example, Navier-Stokes, however --Schrodinger's equation, however, maybe the expression of it in a supercomputing or accelerated computing or real-time way ray tracing is a great example. Real-time way has never been discovered. Does that make sense? Okay. And so, as you know, Navier-Stokes is insanely complicated algorithm. And to be able to refactor that in a way that can run in real-time is insanely complicated as well and requires a lot of invention and some of the inventions, some of our computer scientists in our company have Oscars. There's award-winning computer scientists because they've solved these problems at such a large scale that you use it for movies. And their inventions are, their algorithms are, their data structures are computer science in itself. Okay. And so we'll dedicate ourselves to these two layers. And then when you package it -- all back in the old days, that's useful for entertainment, media entertainment, science, so on and so forth. But today, because AI has brought this technology so close to application, simulating molecules used to be a thing that you do in universities. Now you can do that at work. So as we now reformulate all of these algorithms for the consumption of enterprise, it becomes enterprise software. Enterprise software like nobody's ever seen before. We call them -- we're going to put them in NIMs, these packages. We'll have hundreds of them, and we'll manufacture these things and support them and maintain them and keep them performant and so on, to support customers with it. And so we'll produce NIMs at a very large scale, is my guess. And this is going to be, we call that underneath the entire bucket of software, we call NVIDIA AI Enterprise. A NIM is basically an AI in a microservice for enterprise. And so my expectation is that this is going to be a very large business, and this is the part of the industrial revolution.", "start_char_idx": 30336, "end_char_idx": 33970, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd9b3d58-f687-4637-abf7-32b5bb4d21ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd9b3d58-f687-4637-abf7-32b5bb4d21ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "010bb0a3-8033-4fa6-8a91-193ecb5e36dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "cfc7478a77493fdc969052f9a154596f36d35eb3803bac34579a4cb2f3852e3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1339863-1c9d-497a-a4cf-8f2bb69cfacb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3aaa0c324f2b173739ae0a939b2fabccb1e53b1f3ebd9b739165f726e66ca8d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "730c1df0c2f339595337c9506b5ef1ebd0d07ec017b767c6b50abcb6f837e53d", "text": "So as we now reformulate all of these algorithms for the consumption of enterprise, it becomes enterprise software.

That's not where we're going to play. We're going to play on the layer above. That layer above is a bunch of AIs and these algorithms, really, we are the right company to go build them. And so we'll build some with them, we'll build some ourselves, but we'll package them up and deploy it at enterprise scale. Okay. And so I appreciate you asking the question. And while she's walking there. Go ahead. Yeah.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nHi. Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Thank you, Jensen. Thank you Colette for the presentation. So Jensen my question is perhaps a little more near to medium term, which is just the size of the addressable market, because your revenues have gotten big so quickly. And when I look at how much they represent as a percentage of the spending of some of your large customers they are like 30%, 40%, 50%, sometimes more, but when I look at how much money they are generating from generative AI is like less than 10% of their sales. So, how long can this gap persist? Right. And then more importantly, are we kind of midway through how much of their spending can be spent on your products? So just I think in the past you have given us kind of a trillion-dollar market, going to $2 trillion. If you could just educate us on how large the market is? And where are we in that adoption curve based on how much it can be -- based on how much it's being monetized in the near-to-medium term?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nOkay. I'm going to first give you the super-condensed version, and I'll come back and work it out. Okay. So the answer for how big the market is? How big we can be has to do with the size of the market and what we sell. Remember, what we sell is a data center. I just broke it into parts. But in the end, I sold the data center. Notice that the last image you saw at the keynote, it's a reminder of what we actually sell. We showed a bunch of chips. But remember, we don't really sell that. The chips don't work all by themselves. You can buy the chips, but they don't work. You need to build them into our system. And most importantly, the system software and the ecosystem stack is really complicated. And so NVIDIA builds entire data centers for AI. And we just break it up into parts of that. It fits into your company. So that's number one. What do we sell? And what is the opportunity? The opportunity for the world today, the data center size is $1 trillion. Right. And it's a $1 trillion worth of installed, $250 billion a year.", "start_char_idx": 33218, "end_char_idx": 36598, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1339863-1c9d-497a-a4cf-8f2bb69cfacb": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1339863-1c9d-497a-a4cf-8f2bb69cfacb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd9b3d58-f687-4637-abf7-32b5bb4d21ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "730c1df0c2f339595337c9506b5ef1ebd0d07ec017b767c6b50abcb6f837e53d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cf515d7-fb27-4d7f-ac6a-70ce4b34da76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1654f8cd0b4347d69028db3a7fe5f1a41b93174023264f0108ab987c00d47e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3aaa0c324f2b173739ae0a939b2fabccb1e53b1f3ebd9b739165f726e66ca8d5", "text": "We showed a bunch of chips.

It fits into your company. So that's number one. What do we sell? And what is the opportunity? The opportunity for the world today, the data center size is $1 trillion. Right. And it's a $1 trillion worth of installed, $250 billion a year. We sell an entire data center in parts and so our percentage of that $250 billion per year is likely a lot, lot, lot higher than somebody who sells a chip. It could be a GPU chip or CPU chip or networking chip. That opportunity hasn't changed from before. But what NVIDIA makes is an accelerated computing platform data center scale. Okay. And so our percentage of $250 billion will likely be higher than the past. Now, second question. How sustainable is it? There are two answers for that. One reason that you buy NVIDIA is for AI. If you just build TPUs, if your GPU is only used for one application, then you have to hang your hat on a 100% of that. What can you monetize of AI today? Token generation returns. However, if your value proposition is that AI token generation but that AI training the model and very importantly, reducing the cost of expense of computing, accelerated computing, sustainable computing, energy-efficient computing that's what NVIDIA does for a living at its core. It's just we did it so well that generative AI was created. Okay. And now people forgot that it's a little bit like our first application was computer graphics. And the first application was games. We did that so well, we did it so passionately people forgot, we are accelerated computing company. They thought, hey, you're a gaming company, and a whole generation of young people grew up. And once they learn, they use RIVA 128 and they went to college with GeForce, and then when they finally became an adult, they thought you were a gaming company. And so -- we just do -- we do accelerated computing so well. We do AI so well, people think that that's all we do. But accelerated computing is a trillion -- it's $250 billion a year. $250 billion a year should go to accelerated computing with or without AI, just for the sake of a sustainable computing, just to process SQL, which is, as you guys know, one of the largest consumption of computing in the world. Okay. So I would say $250 billion a year should go to accelerated computing no matter what. And then on top of there is generative AI. How sustainable do I think generative AI is going to be? You know how I feel about it. I think we're going to be generating words, images, videos, proteins, chemicals, kinetic action, manipulation. We're going to be generating forecasts. We're going to be generating bill plans. We're going to be generating bill of materials, we're going to be generating list goes on.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nHi, Jensen, Colette. Thanks. It's Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research. I wanted to ask about the interplay between CPUs and GPUs.

It's Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research. I wanted to ask about the interplay between CPUs and GPUs. Most of the benchmarks, if not all of them, that you showed yesterday, were really around the Grace Blackwell system that had, I guess, two GPUs and one CPU sort of doubled the CPU per GPU ratio versus Grace Hopper. You didn't talk a lot about benchmarks relative to the standalone GPUs. Is this a shift? Are you guys looking for much more CPU content, I guess, in these AI servers going forward? And then how do I think about the interplay between the ARM CPUs that you're developing and x86 seems like you're putting a little less emphasis on the x86 side of things going forward.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYeah, Stacy. Appreciate the question. You the -- there is actually zero concern about either one of them. I think x86 and ARM are both perfectly fine for data centers. There's a reason why Grace is built, the way it is. Grace is built in such a way, the benefit of ARM is that we could mold the NVIDIA system architecture around the CPU. So that we can create this thing called chip to chip, the NVLink that connects between the GPU and the CPU. We can make the two sides coherent, meaning, when the CPU touches a register it invalidates the same register on the GPU side. As a result, the two sides can work together on one variable coherently. You can't do that today between x86 and peripherals and so we were able to solve some problems that we couldn't solve otherwise. And as a result, Grace Hopper is insanely great for CAE applications which is multi-physics. Some of it is running on CPUs, some of it is on GPUs. It's insanely great for different combinations of CPU and GPUs. So that we can have very large memories associated with each maybe one GPU or two GPU coherently. And so we can solve some of these problems, data processing, for example, insanely great on Grace Hopper. Okay. And so it's just harder to solve not because the CPU itself but because we couldn't adopt the system. Second, the reason why I showed I will say that there was one chart where I showed Hopper versus Blackwell on x86 systems B100, B200 and then also GB200 which is the Grace Blackwell. The benefit of Blackwell in that case wasn't because the CPUs better. It's because in the case of Grace Blackwell we were able to create a larger NVLink domain. And that larger NVLink domain is really, really important for the next generation of AI. The next three years, the next three -- five years, which is, as far as we can see right now. If you really want a good inference performance, you're going to need NVLink. That was the message, I was trying to deliver. And we're going to talk more about this. It's abundantly clear now, these large language models, they're never going to fit on one GPU. Okay. That's not the point, anyways. And in order for you to be sufficiently responsive and have high throughput to keep the cost down, you need a lot more GPUs than what you even fit in. And in order to have a lot of GPUs working together without the overhead, the IO overhead getting in the way you need NVLink. NVLinks benefit and inference every -- always thought NVLinks benefit is in training. NVLinks benefit and inference is off the charts. That's the difference between 5X and 30X that was another 6X, it's all NVLink. NVLinks in the new Tensor Core, excuse me.

And so the Grace gives us the ability to architect a system exactly as we needed and it's harder to do it with x86. That's all. But we support both. We'll have two versions of both. And in the case of B100 it just slides into where H100 and H200 goes into. And so the adoption of transition for Hopper to Blackwell is instantaneous. The moment it's available you just slide it in and then you can figure out what to do about the next data center. Okay. So we get the benefit of extremely excellent performance at its limit of the architecture as well as easy-peasy transition.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nThank you.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nHey there. It's Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Hey, Jensen, Colette. Thank you. Good morning for doing this. I wanted to -- Jensen for you to comment on a couple topics that I've been noodling on. One of which is NIMs that you guys talked about yesterday, it seems like a vertical-specific accelerant for people to get into AIE and onboard customers more quickly. I wonder if you could just give us an overview of how your company is going at broader enterprise and just what different vehicles there are for people to onboard into AI? The second topic is on power. My team has been spending a good bit of time on power. I'm trying to decide if I should spend more time there or less. Some of the systems you introduced yesterday are up to 100 kilowatts or more. I know that scale of computing couldn't be done without the integration that you guys are doing, but also we are getting questions on power generation at the macro-level, power delivery to the cabinet at that density. I just would love to hear your thoughts about how your company is working with the industry to power these systems. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nOkay. I'll start with the second first. Power delivery, 100 kilowatts as you know for computer is a lot, but 100 kilowatts is a commodity, you guys know that, right. The world needs a lot more than 120 kilowatts. And so the absolute amount of power is not an issue. The delivery of the power is not an issue. And the physics of delivering the power is not an issue. And cooling 120 kilowatts is not an issue. We can all agree on that. Okay. And so none of this is a physics problem. None of this requires invention. All of it require supply chain planning. Makes sense. So that's the way. And how big of a deal is supply chain planning? A lot. I mean, we take it very seriously. And so we think about supply chain planning for all the time and you got to go at, the reason why we have great partnerships with. If you go -- I think if you look at Vertiv, I think the front pages of paper that we wrote together. So Vertiv and NVIDIA engineers working on cooling systems. Okay. And so Vertiv is very important in the supply chain of designing liquid cooled and otherwise data centers.", "start_char_idx": 41796, "end_char_idx": 45289, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45aeb2a2-1ef0-437b-af8c-03a39fcbdedb": {"__data__": {"id_": "45aeb2a2-1ef0-437b-af8c-03a39fcbdedb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c19384d-c6f4-4973-9f57-4a4b864cdffc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "8681e1a7c3d2d9b4a59801c107cfd0562cb96d7f3e7850a1a08625805d08fed1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fce383fe-618a-4577-a98c-86d58e3d50d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "74647a15bcdbaf2e5490cd71c09e70cc1d401d2903613b353020a2df2f83dba9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "77cdc9d5105442b546e91c4c14b69f396dbbeeea42125a9876580a7bb4c85008", "text": "We can all agree on that.

And so Vertiv is very important in the supply chain of designing liquid cooled and otherwise data centers. We have great partnerships with Siemens. We have great partnerships with Rockwell, Schneider for all the reasons. This is exactly the same as having great partnerships with TSMC and Samsung and SPIL and Wistron and so on and so forth. And so we're going to have to go -- our company supply chain relationships are quite broad and quite deep. And thus the fact that we build our own data centers, really help that. We've been building supercomputers now for quite some time. This is not our first time. Our first supercomputer was DGX-1 in 2016 that kind of puts in perspective. And we've built one every year and this year we're building several. And so the fact that we're building it, it gives us tactile sensation of who we're working with, who are the best and we do it for that very reason, one of the reasons for that. NIMs. There are two onboard. Two-ways to onboard into enterprise. There is the most impactful way. And then there's the other way. Okay. They're both important. The other -- I'll start with the other. The other way is that we are going to create these NIMs. We are going to put it on our website. And we're going to go through GSIs and a lot of solution providers and they're going to help companies turn these NIMs into applications. And that's going to have a whole thing. That's going to have a whole thing, okay. And so that go-to-market includes large GSIs and smaller specialized GSIs and so on and so forth okay. We have lots of partnerships in that area. The other area that I think it's really quite exciting. And I think that this is really where big action is going to happen is the trillion dollars of enterprise companies in the world. They create tools today. In the future they're going to offer you tools plus copilots. Remember, the single most pervasive tool in the world is Office. And now copilots for office. There is another tool that is super important to NVIDIA Synopsys, Cadence, Ansys. We would like to have copilots for all of them. Notice we were building copilots for our own tools. We call them ChipNeMo. And ChipNeMo is super smart. And ChipNeMo now understands NVIDIA Lingo, NVIDIA Chip Talk and it knows how to program NVIDIA programs. And so every engineer that we hire the first thing we're going to tell them, here's ChipNeMo, and then there's the bathroom, and then there's the cafeteria, and so, in that order. And so they will be productive right away whether you lunch, they could ChipNeMo could be doing some stuff. And so that just gives you an example. But we have copilots are being built on top of our own tools all over the place. Most companies probably can't do this, and we can teach the GSIs to do this, but in the area of these tools Cadence and others, they're going to build their own copilots. And they will rent them out as hire them out as engineers.", "start_char_idx": 44616, "end_char_idx": 48121, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fce383fe-618a-4577-a98c-86d58e3d50d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fce383fe-618a-4577-a98c-86d58e3d50d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "45aeb2a2-1ef0-437b-af8c-03a39fcbdedb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "77cdc9d5105442b546e91c4c14b69f396dbbeeea42125a9876580a7bb4c85008", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a54e363b-2b8d-48be-9c04-394ff1e7f414", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15456c54b458f3a6080667ae692bb31b98b4b62ac5547cc3b6876250eac47762", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "74647a15bcdbaf2e5490cd71c09e70cc1d401d2903613b353020a2df2f83dba9", "text": "And so every engineer that we hire the first thing we're going to tell them, here's ChipNeMo, and then there's the bathroom, and then there's the cafeteria, and so, in that order.

And they will rent them out as hire them out as engineers. I think they're sitting on a goldmine. SAP is going to do that. ServiceNow is going to do that and they're very specialized copilots. They understand languages like -- in the case of SAP, ABAP is that right, which is a language that only an SAP lever would love and as you know, ABAP is a very important language for the world's ERP systems. Every company runs on it. We use ABAP. And so now they have to go create a Chat ABAP and that Chat ABAP, just like ChipNeMo or ChatUSD that we created for Omniverse and so Siemens will do that, Rockwell will do that, so on so forth. Does that makes sense? And that I think is another way, you get to enterprise and that ServiceNow is going to do that. Lots and lots of copilots they're building. And that's how they can create another industry on top of their current industry, it's almost like an AI workforce industry. Yeah. I am super excited about the partnerships we have with all of them. Just I'm so excited for them. Every time I see them, I just -- I tell them, anywhere you're sitting on a goldmine, you're sitting on a goldmine. I mean I'm so excited for them.\n\nTim Arcuri\n\nJensen, hi. It's Tim Arcuri at UBS. I had a question also about the TAM and it's more greenfield versus brownfield, because up until now H100 was pretty much all greenfield. So people weren't taking A100s and ripping them out and replacing them with H100s, could B100 be the first time, where you see some brownfield upgrades where we go in and we rip out A100s and we replace them with B100s? So that may be the TAM, if the $1 trillion goes to $2 trillion, you have a four-year replacement cycle. You're talking about $500 billion, but much of that growth comes from upgrading the existing installed base. Wondering if you can comment on that.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYeah, really good question. Today, we are upgrading the slowest computers in the data center, which will be the CPUs. And so that's what should happen. And then eventually you'll get around to the Amperes and then you get around to the Hoppers. I do believe that in five, six, seven, eight years, you're going to give you --we're going to be in -- picker you're out there I'm not picking one. I'm just saying in the outer years, you're going to start seeing replacement cycles, obviously, of our own infrastructure.

It's Brett Simpson here at Arete Research, and thanks for hosting a great event this last couple of days. My question was on Inference. I wanted to get your perspective on -- you put up some good performance numbers with the B100 in terms of how Inference compares with H100. How -- what's the message you're giving to customers on cost of ownership around this new platform? And how do you think it's going to compare with ASICs or other Inference platforms in the industry? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nI think for language models, large language models Blackwell with the new transformer engine and NVLink is going to be very, very, very hard to overcome. And the reason for that is the dimensionality of the problem is so large. And TensorRT-LLM this exploration tool, this optimization compiler that I talked about. The architecture underneath the Tensor Cores are programmable. NVLink allows you to connect up whole bunch of GPUs working in tandem with very, very low overhead, basically no overhead. Okay. And so as a result, 64 GPUs is the same as one programmatically. It is incredible. And so when you have 64 GPUs without overhead without this NVLink overhead, if you have to go over the network like Ethernet, it's over. You can't do it. You just wasted everything. And because they all have to communicate with each other, it's called all2all. Whenever all have to communicate each other the slowest link is the bottleneck, right. It's no different than having a city on one side of the river having a city on the other side of the river that bridge that's it. That's the throughput doing -- that defines the throughput. Okay. And that bridge will be Ethernet. On one side is NVLink, on the other side is NVLink Ethernet in the middle makes no sense. So we have to turn that into NVLink. And now we have all of the GPUs working together generating tokens one at a time. Remember the tokens cannot be -- it's not as if you splat out a token because tokens the transformer has to generate the tokens one at a time in sequence. And so this is a very complicated parallel computing problem, okay. And so I think the -- I think Blackwell has raised the bar a lot. Just mountains. Utterly mountains, ASIC or otherwise.\n\nC.J. Muse\n\nHello, Jensen and Colette. C.J. Muse with Cantor. Thank you for hosting this. And it's great to see you both. Question on your pricing strategy. Historically, you talked about the more you buy, the more you save. But it sounds like initial pricing on Blackwell is coming in at perhaps maybe a lower premium than the productivity that you're offering. So, curious, as you think about maybe razor, razor blade and selling software and the full system, how that might cause you to kind of evolve your pricing strategy and how we should think about kind of normalized margins within that construct? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThe pricing that we create always starts from TCO. I appreciate that comment, C.J. We always come from TCO. However, we also want to have the TCO not of the main body of customers. And so when the customers -- when you only have one particular domain of customers, let's say, molecular dynamics, then if it's only one application, then you set the TCO based on that one application. It could be a medical imaging system.

In every single generation that goes by, our market size is growing, isn't that right? And we want to make the entire market be able to afford Blackwell. And so in a way, it's kind of a self-carrying problem. As we solve for the TCO for a much larger problem -- larger market then some customers would get too much value, if you will. But that's okay. But you're making the business simpler, having one basic product and you're able to support a very, very large market. Now, over time, if the market were to bifurcate, then we can always segment, but that's we're nowhere near that today. And so I think we have the opportunity to create a product that delivers extraordinary value for many and extremely good value for all. And that's our purpose.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nHi. Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. It seems like the most impressive specs that you showed were around GB200, which you just described as a function of having that bigger NVLink domain. Can you contrast what you're doing with GB200 with what you did with GH200? And why you think it could be a much bigger product this time around?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nOh, great question. The simple answer is GH200, 100, 200, Grace Hopper, before it could really take off significantly, Grace Blackwell is already here. And Grace Hopper had the additional burden that Hopper didn't have. Hopper fit right into where Ampere left off. A100s went to H100s, they're going to go to B100s, so on and so forth. And so that particular chassis or that particular use case is fairly well established and we'll just keep on moving. Software is built for it. People know how to operate it so on and so forth. Grace Hopper is a little different and it addressed a new class of applications that we didn't address very well before. And I was mentioning some of it earlier. Multi physics problems with a CPU and GPU was having to work closely together, very large data sets, so on and so forth. Difficult to paralyze, for example, those kind of problems Grace Hopper was really good for. And so we started developing software for that. My recommendation for most customers is, at this point, just gear for Grace Blackwell and I have given them that recommendation. And so everything that they do with Grace Hopper will be completely architecturally compatible. That's the wonderful thing. And so, whatever they have, whatever they buy is still fantastic, but I would recommend that they put all their energy into Grace Blackwell because it's so much better.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nJensen, Collete, thanks for having us here today.

First of all, I appreciate that. I showed Earth-2, two years ago. And two years later, we have this new algorithm that is able to do regional weather prediction at 3 kilometers. The supercomputer you need to do that is 25 times larger, excuse me, 25,000 times larger than the one that you currently use to do weather simulations at NOA and in Europe and so on and so forth. 3 kilometer resolution is very high resolution, if you will, right above your head, okay. And weather simulation also requires a whole lot of what is called ensembles because the world looks chaotic and you want to simulate a lot of distribution, sample a lot of different parameters, a lot of different perturbations, and try to figure out what is that distribution and that the middle of that distribution likely is going to be the weather pattern. Well, if it takes that much energy just to do it one time, they're not going to do it more than one time. But in order to predict where weather is going to be a week from now, especially extreme weather that can change so dramatically, you're going to need a lot of what they call members, a lot of ensemble members, a lot of samplings. And so you're basically doing -- we're basically doing weather simulation 10,000 times, okay. And because we train an AI to understand physics and it's physically possible and it can't hallucinate, so it has to understand the laws of physics and such. And so two years ago, I showed it today and we connected into the most trusted source of weather in the world, the weather company. And so we're going to help people do regional weather all over the world. If you're a shipping company and you need to know weather conditions. If you're an insurance company, you need to know weather conditions. If you're in the Southeast Asia region, you have so many hurricanes and typhoons and things like that, you need some of this technology. And so we're going to help people adapt it for their region and their use case. Well, I did that a couple of years ago. The ChatGPT moment kind of works like this. Take a step back and ask yourself what happened with ChatGPT? The technology is insanely great, okay. It's really incredible. But there's several things that happened. One, it learned from a whole lot of human examples. We wrote the words, right? It was our words. So it learned from our human examples and it generalized it. So it's not repeating back the words. So it can understand the context and it can generate a regional form. It understood the context meanings that it adapted to itself, okay, or it adapted to the current circumstance, the context. And then the third thing is, it could now generate original tokens. Now I'm going to take everything back into tokens. Forget words, just tokens now. Use all the same words that I just use, but replace words with tokens. If I could just figure out how to communicate with this computer, what this token means? Okay, if I can just tokenize this. Just as when you do speech recognition, you tokenized my sound, my voice. Just as when we reconstructed proteins, we tokenized the amino acids. You can tokenize almost everything. You can digitize a simple way of representing each chunk of the data, okay. So once you can tokenize it, then you can learn it.", "start_char_idx": 56445, "end_char_idx": 60273, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8a077ac-0c2b-4597-8b9b-cc4760dae452": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8a077ac-0c2b-4597-8b9b-cc4760dae452", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2927f61-2a19-490b-b59d-2ee08631462c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "9998e62c8b150134fc6de80a79366cd8541ddd9c77e1b5d5d0d3b353394da222", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7517252b-a83c-42fc-a217-a6c55c7cedd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6b3ae1bb2deaca3a8880ddbecc1aeab9642c3812ea5a518e6903918b06c5f98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c17cd266a55d59e23101c761112b7d0049c25d1a82c255c9f8878c6edf69701d", "text": "And then the third thing is, it could now generate original tokens.

I just did the ChatGPT moment, how is it any different? The computer doesn't know. Now, of course, the problem space is a lot more complicated because it's physical things. So, you need this thing called alignment. And what was the great invention of ChatGPT, reinforcement, learning human feedback alignment. Is that right? So, it would try something. You say no, that's not as good as this. It would try something else. You said, no, that's not as good as this. Human feedback, reinforcement learning and it keeps -- it takes that reinforcement and improves itself. And so what is Omniverse for? Well, if it's in a robot, then how would you do feedback? And what is feedback about? It's physical feedback, physics feedback. It generalized -- it generated a movement to go pick up a cup, but it tipped a cup over. It needs the reinforcement learning to know when to stop. Does that make sense? And so that feedback system is not human. That feedback system is physics. And that physics simulation feedback is called Omniverse. So Omniverse is reinforcement learning, physical feedback, which grounds the AI to the physical world, just as reinforcement learning human feedback grounds the AI to human values. Are you guys following me? I just described two completely different domains using exactly the same concepts. And so what I've done is I've generalized general AI. And by generalizing it, I can reapply it somewhere else. And so we made this observation some time ago and we started preparing for this. And now you're going to find that Isaac Sim, which is a gym on top of Omniverse is going to be super, super successful for just about anybody who is doing these robotic systems. We've created the operating system for robots. I'm sure there's a corporate answer for all the questions you guys ask, but unfortunately, I only know how to answer the one geek way.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nHi. I am Atif Malik from Citigroup. I have a question for Colette. Colette in your slides, you talked about availability for the Blackwell platform later this year. Can you be more specific? Is that the October quarter or the January quarter? And then on the supply chain, readiness for the new products is the packaging, particularly on the B200 CoWoS-L and how you are getting your supply chain ready for the new products?\n\nColette Kress\n\nYeah, so let me let me start with your second part of the question, talking about the supply-chain readiness.

That's something that we've been working well over a year getting ready for these new products coming to market. We feel so privileged to have the partners that work with us in developing out our supply chain. We've continued to work on resiliency and redundancy. But also, you're right, moving into new areas, new areas of CoWoS, new areas of memory, and just a sheer volume of components and complexity of what we're building. So that's well on its way and will be here for when we are ready to launch our products. So there is also a part of our supply chain as we talked earlier today, talking about the partners that will help us with the liquid cooling and the additional partners that will be ready in terms of building out the full of the data center. So this work is a very important part to ease the planning and the processing to put in all of our Blackwell different configurations. Going back to your first part of the question, which is when do we think we're going to come to market? Later this year, late this year, you will start to see our products come to market. Many of our customers that we have already spoken with talked about the designs, talked about the specs, have provided us their demand desires. And that has been very helpful for us to begin our supply chain work, to begin our volumes and what we're going to do. It's very true though that on the onset of the very first one coming to market, there might be constraints until we can meet some of the demand that's put in front of us. Hope that answers the question.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYeah, That's right. And just remember that Hopper and Blackwell, they're used for people's operations and people need to operate today. And the demand is so great for Hoppers. They -- most of our customers have known about Blackwell now for some time, just so you know. Okay, so they've known about Blackwell. They've known about the schedule. They've known about the capabilities for some time. As soon as possible, we try to let people know so they can plan their data centers and notice the Hopper demand doesn't change. And the reason for that is they have an operations they have to serve. They have customers today and they have to run the business today, not next year.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nOkay.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nPierre Ferragu, New Street Research. So, like a geeky question on Blackwell and --\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThank you.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nThe two dyes and the 10 terabytes between the two dyes, can you tell us about how you achieve that? How much work you've put over the years into being able to achieve that technically like from a manufacturing standpoint? And then how you see the future in your roadmap, looking further away? Do you think we're going to see more and more dyes getting together into a single package? So that's one side of my question, which is more like on the chip and the architecture. And the other side is, you must be seeing like all these models that are like Sam Altman said, behind the veil of ignorance. And so can you tell us about what you see and how you see the next generation of models influencing your architecture? And so what's the direction of travel for GPU architecture for data center AI?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYeah, I'll start with the second. This is one of the great things about being the platform where all AI research is done. And so we get the benefit of seeing everything that's coming down the pike.

This is one of the great things about being the platform where all AI research is done. And so we get the benefit of seeing everything that's coming down the pike. And, of course, all next generation models are intended to push the limits of current generation systems to its limit. And so large context windows, for example, insanely large context windows, state space vectors, synthetic data generation, essentially models talking to themselves, reinforcement learning, essentially AlphaGo of large language models, Tree Search. These models are going to have to learn how to reason and do multipath planning. And so instead of one shot, it's a little bit like us thinking we have to work through our plan. And that planning system, that reasoning system, multistep reasoning systems could be quite abstract and the path could be quite long, just like playing go. And so -- but the constraints are much, much more difficult to describe. And so this whole area of research is super, super exciting. The type of systems that we're going to see in the next several years, a couple of two, three years, is unimaginable compared to today for the reasons I described. There are some concern about the amount of Internet data that's available for training these models, but that's just not true. 10 trillion tokens is great, but don't forget, synthetic data generation, models talking to each other, reinforcement learning, the amount of data you're going to be generating, it's going to take two computers to train each other. Today we have one computer training on data. Tomorrow it's going to be two computers, just -- right? Don't forget. Remember, AlphaGo. It's multiple systems competing against -- playing against each other, okay, so that we could do that as quickly as possible. So some really exciting ground-breaking work around the corner. All right. The one thing that we're certain is that the scale of these -- the scale of our GPUs, they want to be even bigger. The SerDes of our company is world class. NVIDIA's SerDes are absolutely the world's best. The data rate and the energy consumed, the data rate, the picojoule per bit in our company is unbelievably good. It is the reason why we were able to do NVLink. Remember, NVLink was because we could not make a chip big enough and so we connected eight of them together. This is in 2016. We're on NVLink Gen 5. The rest of the world doesn't even have NVLink Gen 1 yet. NVLink Gen 5 allows us to connect 576 chips together. They are together as far as I'm concerned. The data center is so big, does it have to be this close together? No, not at all. And so it's okay to split them up 576 ways. And the SerDes are so low energy anyways. Now we could make even closer chips. Now, the reason why we want that is because then the software cannot tell the difference. When you break up chips, the algorithm should be build the largest chip that lithography can make and then put multiple of them together. However, whatever technology is available to do so. But you start by building the largest chip ever. Otherwise, why didn't we do multichip back in the old days? We just kept pushing, right, monolithic as far as. And the reason for that is because the data rate on chip and the energy on chip allows for the programming model to be as uniform as possible.", "start_char_idx": 65731, "end_char_idx": 69508, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8348106-9193-40bb-9e1a-643952a98a68": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8348106-9193-40bb-9e1a-643952a98a68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "baa8e0eb-e79b-4da2-8968-c512c2268b81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d6528cc2ecb3f5706a3537cb5f1b3298685fe674865220ed508d3455cfcd858b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9247c57b-7eba-4255-b14f-83b8fd9be3b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42f8cbe3fc85364509fd3d933ebdb03b82689ebf9b3892c4467b75f0cd43955e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1cbbc51838f3d7bf03e62ba4beede4b517479d448f33ec48c05352bcd6b213ad", "text": "No, not at all.

And the reason for that is because the data rate on chip and the energy on chip allows for the programming model to be as uniform as possible. You don't have these things called, speaking of geeking out NUMA, non-uniform memory access, right? So you don't have NUMA behavior. You don't have weird cache behavior. You don't have memory locality behavior, which causes the programs to work differently depending on the nodes that the systems they run on. We want our software to run exactly the same wherever they are. And so you start with the biggest chip possible. That's the first Blackwell dye. We connect the two of them together. The technology 10 terabytes per second is insane. Nobody's ever seen 10 terabytes per second link before. That's 10 terabytes per second and it obviously consumes very little power, otherwise it would be nothing but that link. And so we -- you had to solve that number one. The second thing you had to solve was the question that came up before was CoWoS. It's the largest CoWoS in the world, because the first generation CoWoS was already the largest CoWoS in the world. Now the second generation is even larger. The benefit that we have is we're not surprised this time. The volume ramp demand happened fairly sharply last time, but this time we've had plenty of visibility. And so Colette is absolutely right. We've worked with the supply chain, worked with TSMC very closely. We are geared up for an exciting ramp.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nThis will be the last question then.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nBummer. Come on.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nWow, thank you. Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo. I really appreciate all this detail. I'm actually going to dovetail off this last comment, because today you started the conversation by talking a little bit about Ethernet and how Ethernet with Ultra.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nI love Ethernet.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nYeah. So I want to understand a little bit, NVLink, 576 GPUs now interconnected together. This idea of the fabric architecture, where does that play relative to the evolution of Ethernet, your Spectrum 4 product, this move to 800 gig? I'm just trying to understand the interplay between those and whether or not you see NVLink competing with Ethernet in those environments.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nNo. First, the algorithm is actually very simple. First, build the largest dye you possibly can. So big that if you added one more transistor, it would literally fall on the ground. That's algorithm number one. And look at the chips that we build. They're literally the largest. They're radicle limits. Number two. If possible, connect the two of them -- connect two of them together. You're not going to connect four of them together. That's not going to happen. But if you can connect two of them together and that's the Blackwell invention. We now know how to build dice that big. But beyond that, you're going to have all kinds of weird NUMA effects and locality effects. You might as well go to NVLink.", "start_char_idx": 68787, "end_char_idx": 72309, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9247c57b-7eba-4255-b14f-83b8fd9be3b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9247c57b-7eba-4255-b14f-83b8fd9be3b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2f8f441-cf18-4a39-825a-859052bc880a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d2b6d399eb8835295defbc8803957d84cdd39c066f07fff92106842cefa74110", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8348106-9193-40bb-9e1a-643952a98a68", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/29.html", "file_name": "29.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 80269, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "1cbbc51838f3d7bf03e62ba4beede4b517479d448f33ec48c05352bcd6b213ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8dcad698-cce2-484f-8895-899afb65463c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1a5108e38dc33cb6f1bc8370845d1c61535e5f9d285ed5e3660c5a46cf90a60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "42f8cbe3fc85364509fd3d933ebdb03b82689ebf9b3892c4467b75f0cd43955e", "text": "First, the algorithm is actually very simple.

But beyond that, you're going to have all kinds of weird NUMA effects and locality effects. You might as well go to NVLink. And so once you get to NVLink, the question is -- and of course, we're in Gen 5. If you don't have NVLink, then you're kind of stuck. Okay, you can't build systems like this. But if you have NVLink, then the next part is build NVLink as large as you can, modulated by power and cost. And that's the reason why NVLink is direct connect. It's direct drive, not because optical transceivers are out of fashion. Optical? Are you kidding me? We love optical. We need optical. We're going to use tons of optical. But you should build the NVLink as large as you can using copper, because you could save a lot of power, you could save a lot of money. You can make it scalable, sufficiently scalable. Now, you've got one giant chip, 576 GPU chip effectively. But that's only 576 GPU chips. That's not enough. And so we're going to have to connect multiple of them. The next click after that, the best thing you have is InfiniBand. The second best you have is Ethernet with an augmented computing layer on top of it we call Spectrum X, so that we can control the traffic that's in the system, so that we don't have these long tails. Remember, as I said, the last one to finish determines the speed of the computer. This is not an average throughput. This is not like all of us individually are accessing hyperscale and our average throughput is good enough. This is literally the last person who finishes that partial product, who finishes that tensor. Everybody else is waiting on them. I don't know who it is in this room. That's going to be the last, but we're going to hope that that person doesn't hold up right. And so we're going to make sure that that last one is -- we push everything to the middle. We only want one answer. It all shows up at the right time. Okay. And so that's the second best. And then you scale that out as much as you can and that's going to need optics and so on and so forth. There's a place for all of it. I think if anybody's concerned about optics, don't be concerned. We're -- I think the demand for optics is very, very high. Demand for repeaters is very, very high. We didn't change anything about that. All we did was we made computers larger, we made GPUs larger. Can we take one more question?

That would be one question. And I guess my second question is, like, I'm going to go home. I'm going to see my 91-year-old mother. How can I try to explain to some 91 year old what accelerated computing? I guess, I've got a good answer of the first question. I'll figure out the second one. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nOkay. Yeah, I don't know what you were going to say on the second one, but on the second one, I would say use the right tools for the right job. And right now, general purpose computing, you're using the same tool for every single job. Literally what you have is a screwdriver and you're using it from the moment you woke up to the moment you go to bed. And so you start with you brushing your teeth with a screwdriver. It probably works. I haven't tried it, but it probably works. And so you just use that one tool the whole day. Now, of course, because you're going to use that one tool for the whole day, over time humans have gotten pretty smart. And so we made that general purpose tool. And so now the screwdriver has brushes on it, it's got hair on it. So then it becomes useful for all kinds of stuff. And you could also use it to clean the bathroom and all that kind of stuff. And so one tool. Was that the answer you were going to give? All right. So, we created basically two tools. We said that the CPU is incredibly good at sequential things and what it's not good at is parallel things. Now, the parallel things, the weird thing is this, for most applications, let's say XL, the parallel part is not very much. That's the reason why CPUs are really the best processor for XL. For your web browser, except for graphics that we came along later, most web browsers are largely single threaded. Java is largely single threaded. And so for many applications of personal computing is largely single threaded and then CPU is really quite ideal. And then all of a sudden, there's this new application that came along, computer graphics, video games, where literally 1% of the code is 99% of the runtime. Do you guys understand what I'm saying? 1% of the code is 99% of the runtime. And the reason for that is because it's computing the pixels one at a time. So 1% of the code is 99% of the runtime. And we said, look at that. How interesting. Why don't we take, go create something that's insanely good at 1% of the runtime, meaning it's bad at 99% of the runtime. Excuse me, bad at 99% of the code. It's good at 1% of the code. And we go create applications or find applications where that 1% of the code is 99% of the runtime. Molecular dynamics, medical imaging, seismic processing, artificial intelligence, makes sense. That's why accelerated computing, data processing, so on and so forth where 1% of the code is 99% of the runtime. And that's the reason why we get such great speed up.

All right.\n\nColette Kress\n\nSovereign AI\n\nJensen Huang\n\nSovereign AI. Every country has their own natural resource and that natural resource is called their intelligence. It's in their language. India has their own language. They have many of them, lots of different dialects. They have their own language, their sensibility, their culture, their history. It belongs to them. And a lot of it is in their national archives and is digitized. It's not actually on the Internet. It belongs to them. They ought to take that and go create their own sovereign AI. And they believe the same. Sweden is the same way. Japan is going to do the same. You name it. Companies -- countries all over the world realize that this is their natural resource and they shouldn't let it just be used by anybody to then import their natural resource back to them in an automated way by paying somebody else. Don't let their data go out for free and import AI. They now realize it ought to be the other way around that they should keep their own data and then export AI. And so export the AI of Korea, export the AI of Malaysia, export the AI of, you name it, Middle East countries. So, we have export control limitations on our products. And in most of the areas, the answer is it's not export control. And if there's any export control, we can still work with the US government and make sure that the export is going to be fine. But we, number one, just make sure that we're compliant with export control and in some countries we have to offer degraded products or -- I didn't say that right or lower specification products. And -- but anyways, number one, just be compliant with export controls and help countries around the world to be able to do this. It's a very big market. Yeah, it's a very big market. There are going to be AIs that are going to be trained and continuously refined for just about every culture in the world.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThank you. Do you guys? No, no.

These large, competitively advantaged tech platforms have vastly outperformed the market over the past decade, and they also seem like great bets to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, too.\n\nBut their strong recent run has led many to believe these stocks are either overpriced or fairly priced relative to the rest of the market. On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.\n\nHow to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.\n\nThe PEG ratio\n\nThe PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.\n\nTo calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued.\n\nA PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.\n\nOne standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth.\n\nMagnificent PEG Ratios\n\nHere's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out.\n\nCompany PEG Ratio Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) 1.10 Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.36 Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) 1.49 Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) 1.93 Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) 2.11 Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) 2.12 Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) 2.36\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it's not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other \"disruptive\" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, \"mature\" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.\n\nStill, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its \"Other Bets\" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive.

Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today.\n\nOne big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAre the bottom four worth considering?\n\nTesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable.\n\nMoreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived \"safety\" in good economic environments and bad.\n\nMicrosoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved.\n\nOn the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.\n\nAmazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It's likely that Wall Street analysts aren't projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet's \"other bets,\" since Amazon hasn't really ever harvested profit in a significant way.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices.\n\nThe combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.\n\nDon't just use the PEG\n\nThe PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify.\n\nMoreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor.", "start_char_idx": 2889, "end_char_idx": 7041, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3f4881f-c754-46d6-8cce-a2e7473652d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3f4881f-c754-46d6-8cce-a2e7473652d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/291.html", "file_name": "291.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9365, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "47fbd6a1-d4f1-4fcf-aced-f71b7365a343", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/291.html", "file_name": "291.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9365, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "76f3f42ba82e1c5243f39fe395f00eb87c1cffa509bec786b6ef3c013b748762", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c32a82d6-6be7-41c7-81ab-2be1783d0f5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/291.html", "file_name": "291.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9365, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "60a60083d787cc03cdbf1065b34f6efbce4d036b3bf65571b221ced90aff1878", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "149af4a2-4797-4f03-9424-db652b221ae8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "34af323e241db5b0cac9dcbd6869e24eaa754d06c7976926db8f4a2bfc49ad4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "db6983b837501a2478a1b1edae7f91e2820a6f3fe5f277df0c2b58ae1ab75d85", "text": "In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.\n\nDon't just use the PEG\n\nThe PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth.

But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold.\n\nWhile the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

After starting 2023 being valued at around a $350 billion market cap, Nvidia is now worth about $2.2 trillion.\n\nThat's a dramatic expansion in value and it puts it within striking distance of Microsoft and Apple, which are valued at around $3.1 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively. It's still a sizable gap to close, but it may happen sooner than you think if the right circumstances occur.\n\nHow did Nvidia get so large?\n\nNvidia is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, as it provides the computing power necessary to make these models work. Its primary product, the GPU (graphics processing unit), excels at crunching through arduous workloads. GPUs are connected to create powerful supercomputers, which often have over 1,000 GPUs.\n\nWith Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, rumored to cost about $30,000, there's a lot of potential revenue for Nvidia. When AI demand started to take off during Nvidia's second quarter of 2023 (ending July 30, 2023), that's when its growth really started.\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIn the last three quarters, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled compared to the previous year's results. For the current quarter, which is first quarter of fiscal year 2025, that trend is also expected to continue as management projects $24 billion in revenue -- a 234% projected increase.\n\nAfter Q1, Nvidia will have harder comparisons. However, if it can maintain its revenue levels in the mid-$20 billion range, it will still post strong growth, as Q2 and Q3 of FY 2024 saw $13.5 billion and $18.1 billion in revenue, respectively.\n\nBut will that be enough to surpass Apple and Microsoft?\n\nNvidia isn't as close as some may think\n\nIf Nvidia can achieve its projection of $24 billion in revenue in Q1 and barely grow quarter over quarter throughout the year to attain $100 billion in revenue for FY 2025, that could set Nvidia up nicely.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsing its Q4 profit margin of 55% as a baseline, Nvidia would produce $55 billion in profits. But how does that compare to Microsoft and Apple?\n\nThe chart below shows the trailing 12-month (TTM) total of each company's net income. So, even if Nvidia achieves $55 billion in annual profit, it would still be far behind Microsoft and Apple.\n\nNVDA Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nFor Nvidia to surpass either company, investors would have to place a significant premium on the stock, reflected in an expensive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Nvidia's P/E ratio is already much higher than that of Microsoft or Apple, as it trades for 77 times earnings versus Microsoft's 38 and Apple's 27.\n\nIf Nvidia kept its 77 times earnings price tag with $55 billion in profit, it would be valued at $4.24 trillion, easily surpassing Microsoft as the world's largest company. But that isn't likely.\n\nNvidia's stock is valued at a premium because investors know that this figure will come down as it grows into its newfound business. So, the only way Nvidia will maintain its 77 times earnings premium at the end of this fiscal year is if it continues doubling or tripling its revenue each quarter.\n\nIf Nvidia does that, it will have earned the title of the world's largest company. This seems a far stretch, considering that many GPU orders have already been placed.\n\nWill Nvidia overtake Microsoft or Apple in valuation?

Nvidia said the new chip can enable AI models with a trillion parameters while reducing operating costs and energy consumption.\n\nIn a press release, the company said companies like Amazon Web Services, Dell, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla and xAI are expected to adopt Blackwell.\n\n\"Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,\" Huang said during his keynote address in which he introduced Blackwell as a new \"very, very big GPU\" that binds two silicon squares that are each the size of its predecessor chip so that they function as a single unit.\n\nNVIDIA UNVEILS ROBOTS POWERED BY SUPER COMPUTER AND AI TO TAKE ON WORLD'S HEAVY INDUSTRIES\n\nHuang said that Blackwell's design allows it to easily replace its predecessor, the Grace Hopper chip, \"You slide out Hopper, and you push in Blackwell.

But that didn't stop him from using his two-hour keynote address to cement Nvidia's status as the generative AI bandleader, delivering hardware and software product announcements, including its anticipated next-generation Blackwell AI chip \u2014 and presenting why the chipmaker has become so dominant in the AI market. To our ears, Nvidia's loudest instrument Monday was its growing lineup of software offerings, which is central to our confidence in this \"own it, don't trade it\" stock. That designation used to belong to only Apple , a company Nvidia has taken a page from. Just as Apple has become a company driven by its software and hardware paired together to create an ecosystem, Nvidia is in the midst of a similar transformation. Huang's keynote speech at the long-awaited GTC conference made that clear. \"It's not just a chip. It is a platform. Now what does that mean? It means it's filled with software. What does that mean? It's recurring revenue; it's not one-off,\" Jim Cramer said Tuesday. \"You get into [Nvidia's] ecosystem; you stay in their ecosystem. There are a lot of people who say it's a defensive move. I say it's an offensive move.\" Shares of Nvidia rose about 0.4% Tuesday afternoon, to around $888 apiece, shaking off earlier losses in the session. NVDA 1Y mountain Nvidia's stock performance over the past 12 months. The latest step in the chipmaker's journey beyond hardware is the introduction of Nvidia Inference Microservices. So-called NIMs are prebuilt software packages that developers can use to speed up the development timeline for AI applications, such as copilot tools, using their companies' data and compute infrastructure. NIMs will be included in Nvidia's software subscription for businesses, called AI Enterprise. The goal of NIMs is to make it easier for companies to complete the process of taking existing AI models and deploying them into useful applications, thus driving the adoption and growth of Nvidia's AI services offerings. Nvidia said ServiceNow , which makes workplace automation software, is one customer signed up to use NIMs. NIMs are part of Nvidia's increasingly important software and services business, which reached an annualized revenue rate of $1 billion in the three months ended in January. That is small, considering its full-year sales swelled to $61 billion. But it is growing fast, with a lot of runway. Other Nvidia software and services include DGX Cloud, a supercomputer accessible through a web browser. Drugmaker Amgen uses DGX Cloud, according to Nvidia. \"Everything that we do starts with software,\" Huang told Jim in an interview Tuesday. Nvidia's announcements at GTC came at a critical juncture for the company, as the generative AI boom sparked in late 2022 by the launch of ChatGPT is firmly in its second year and questions swirl about the sustainability of investment into the technology and, by extension, Nvidia's growth. Its sales more than doubled in its fiscal year ended in January, while adjusted profit nearly quadrupled. Shares of Nvidia are up about 500% since the start of 2023, including nearly 80% so far this year. At the same time, Nvidia is facing mounting competition from large customers who are now designing their own AI processors, namely Microsoft and Meta Platforms , and rival semiconductor firms such as Advanced Micro Devices , which late last year started shipping its most advanced chip to challenge Nvidia to date, called the MI300X.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3693, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87d91bc8-0ab4-46af-a8cb-6148ccbbb58e": {"__data__": {"id_": "87d91bc8-0ab4-46af-a8cb-6148ccbbb58e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/299.html", "file_name": "299.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7639, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6c8a7dc0-1679-43a4-adf4-b3b3ae48a554", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/299.html", "file_name": "299.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7639, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f381f3437379073d38a2f1d16b88b9ff2af8b1d75682165c7b6c1d7ee6d7d631", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a395624-f6c4-4080-b530-586a3c4d79b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/299.html", "file_name": "299.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7639, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "9f7e2c7a80e88e542aa89f570f0bf1eac6da36b31180f22bdda6a3b788d630b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "252a6f28-15ee-44c8-a428-f80010acd56c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44005f2f4de47ca29fccc43f991950f48c83512d5399b62b742b3762b827d4b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5924619379a2f7418b3a8097edf4eb92cddffa027057552488c7e231ca7658ab", "text": "Its sales more than doubled in its fiscal year ended in January, while adjusted profit nearly quadrupled.

Nvidia's strong standing in the competitive landscape is fortified by its ability to offer high-quality products for all different AI computing needs: hardware, networking components to tie all the chips together within data centers and software tools needed to build the applications. In the hardware race, Nvidia on Monday once again upped the stakes with the release of its highly anticipated Blackwell chip architecture, which delivers a host of performance improvements compared with its predecessor Hopper on which the immensely popular H100 chip is based. Specifically, Nvidia said Blackwell systems offer up to an 25 times improvement in total cost of ownership and energy consumption. Additionally, the new architecture can perform up to four times as fast in training AI models compared with Hopper-based systems, according to Nvidia, while also speeding up inference tasks \u2014 essentially the day-to-day use of models \u2014 by 30 times. The improved performance on inference is notable, given Nvidia's earnings report last month revealed its chips have played a bigger role in inference than many on Wall Street expected. Nvidia's Blackwell offerings include the GB200 chip, which is two Blackwell-based graphics processing units (GPUs) paired with another kind of processor called a central processing unit (CPU). In his interview with Jim on Tuesday, Huang estimated that one GB200 chip could cost between $30,000 to $40,000. Nvidia also unveiled an entire data center server rack called the GB200 NVL72. The latter is 36 GB200 chips \u2014 meaning 36 CPUs and 72 GPUs \u2014 connected via Nvidia's improved networking components. Early adopters of the new Blackwell architecture include Amazon' s Web Services, Dell Technologies , Alphabet 's Google, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Oracle and Tesla , according to Nvidia. On Monday, Huang said Nvidia expects Blackwell to be \"most successful\" product launch in its history, touting Blackwell as \"a platform\" for AI computing. For example, Huang said a customer currently working on Hopper generation hardware can simply swap in the new Blackwell hardware into their server racks. While that's an important consideration for those looking to upgrade to the latest and greatest, it also reflects how much deeper Nvidia's competitive moat stands to get. With Nvidia advancing its Apple-like transformation with new services like NIMs, customers working on its hardware and utilizing its software are going to become even more deeply embedded in the ecosystems than ever before. Wall Street analysts were generally upbeat on Nvidia's slate of GTC announcements, even though there were not any major surprises. Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Nvidia to $1,000 a share from $875, with analysts saying they had a \"renewed appreciation\" for the company's competition in the AI race. Elsewhere, JPMorgan analysts argued Nvidia \"continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long NVDA, MSFT, META, AAPL and AMZN.

Shares of the chip giant pulled back about 2% during Tuesday's session after announcing its latest AI chips . That, however, didn't stop some Wall Street analysts from upping their price targets on the stock, which is up more than 75% this year, and retaining their bullish stance. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia shares in 2024 \"With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/CPU), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, NVIDIA is well positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view,\" said JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur. \"Bottom line: NVIDIA continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors.\" While Nvidia's latest announcements solidify the company's AI leadership, Wall Street anticipates some positive tailwinds for a slew of derivative players. Here's what the latest Blackwell chips could mean for key players and industry competitors according to Wall Street. Semiconductor derivative plays Nvidia's latest announcements could pose some major tailwinds for companies operating within the chipmaker's ecosystem. Blackwell's higher bandwidth memory needs, for example, could prove a major boon for dynamic random access memory chipmakers such as Micron Technology , according to Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann and Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. \"DRAM density continues to lift with the B100 and B200 each including 192 GB of [high bandwidth memory] (up from the H100's 80 GB),\" said Wedbush's Matt Bryson in a Tuesday note. \"Again we see this increase as positive for DRAM vendors (in light of premium pricing and margins for HBM) as well as the broader memory complex.\" MU YTD mountain Micron shares year to date Another clear winner from Blackwell's debut is Taiwan Semiconductor , since the latest chips harness the company's 4-nanometer process technology. Citi's Laura Chen reiterated the firm's constructive view on the company following the keynote, noting that its close ties to Nvidia in chip design and advanced node manufacturing could more than double the company's AI revenues in 2024. Wall Street also views Marvell Technology as a potential big winner from data center AI growth, with Bank of America anticipating an opportunity for the company in optical transceivers. \"We believe MRVL's growth story remains unchanged and should benefit from the ongoing transition to 800 [gigabits per second],\" wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer. The stock sank more than 4% during Tuesday's session but has added more than 6% this year. Liquid cooling The liquid cooling industry may also benefit as Nvidia harnesses the technology to cool the 72 Blackwell graphics processing units in its new server rack system, known as GB200 NVL72. One potential winner on that front is red-hot AI stock Super Micro Computer , up more than 829% over the past year, according to Mosesmann. VRT 1Y mountain Vertiv shares over the last year Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani also highlighted Vertiv as a potential liquid cooling winner, calling the company the \"best positioned\" to prosper off AI growth due in part to its large-scale, hyperscale-driven contracts and dominant position within power and thermal management. \"We believe built-in liquid cooling capabilities in addition to the power density of the system should be a positive for VRT's liquid cooling and power management businesses,\" he wrote. Vertiv shares have rallied about 53% this year and 459% over the past year. Headwinds to competitors Not every company is poised to benefit from Nvidia's Blackwell chips and their growth potential.

The move \"appears to be a way to fortify Nvidia's primacy in software and models with developers.\"\n\nStein has a buy rating and a $1,177 target price on the stock.\n\nSee also: Dell's stock gets an Nvidia bump, but AMD shares among chip names under pressure\n\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann called Blackwell \"likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed,\" positing that it's sold out \"well into 2025.\" He rates the stock at buy with a $1,400 target price.\n\nBernstein's Stacy Rasgon conceded that it was \"maybe\" hard for Nvidia to live up to all the hype surrounding this year's GTC, but he was nonetheless impressed by Huang's presentation.\n\n\"Blackwell appears likely to be strong, and the company's continued push not just on chips but on broader software and hardware ecosystems remains unmatched (and in our opinion, hard to stand against),\" he wrote. \"We still like what we see here.\"\n\nRasgon, who rates the stock at outperform with a $1,000 price target, began his note: \"Move over Taylor Swift, you're not the only one that can sell out a stadium.\"\n\nStifel's Ruben Roy noted the dramatic step up in inference performance of the new lineup relative to the H100, which he called \"noteworthy as the competitive landscape for longer-tailed inference workloads heats up.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3671, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be1c6d25-eeed-440c-9d51-7d606bae5cc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "be1c6d25-eeed-440c-9d51-7d606bae5cc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/301.html", "file_name": "301.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4513, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "373141d1-0991-4336-9697-12be1eb5b3fa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/301.html", "file_name": "301.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4513, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d767bac6a8c91384c3c29a7c58366e0d5bde1c7ca4466deef5d94e7ce6a9f4c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "76dfe785-ce3f-4092-ae86-f7ba5d5cdb9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/301.html", "file_name": "301.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4513, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "773580d609ad1a2cd3782b831d7ea96c26b0946a5efe87b1f4e5415c52720618", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b39fd41-93b3-4eac-9ce9-f5860fe58ce5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f769b1f1b606471362b3c4953e9bafb988b7a99943fab0d86687e324cd84b40d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8d08d5180255b9a699cc68ec5818860ea3edba3c772b46eab2fde61ef7dcfc6d", "text": "\"Blackwell appears likely to be strong, and the company's continued push not just on chips but on broader software and hardware ecosystems remains unmatched (and in our opinion, hard to stand against),\" he wrote. \"We still like what we see here.\"\n\nRasgon, who rates the stock at outperform with a $1,000 price target, began his note: \"Move over Taylor Swift, you're not the only one that can sell out a stadium.\"\n\nStifel's Ruben Roy noted the dramatic step up in inference performance of the new lineup relative to the H100, which he called \"noteworthy as the competitive landscape for longer-tailed inference workloads heats up.\"\n\nHe also highlighted the long roster of announced customers, which stood in contrast to the company's past H100 launch. \"The majority of AI innovators were named as expected Blackwell adopters at launch,\" he wrote.\n\nRoy has a buy rating and a $910 target price on Nvidia shares.\n\nJPMorgan's Harlan Sur said Nvidia was \"further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time.\"\n\nThe company is a step or two ahead of the competition, Sur added. He stuck with an overweight rating and an $850 target price.\n\n-Emily Bary\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

RXRX.\n\nRecursion's claimed value add is having its AI-backed drug discovery platform get smarter every time it finds a new drug candidate.\n\nNvidia Corp. NVDA is one of its believers, having provided an investment in Recursion that saw Recursion's stock skyrocket 116% the day after the news broke.\n\nRegardless of which company's technology comes out on top, it seems more people in the scientific community are embracing AI's potential to fight the next deadly pandemic or even today's current illnesses.\n\nLoading...

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.\n\n\n\nSanta Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.\n\n\n\nBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.\n\n\n\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\n\n\n\nCompute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.

For Nvidia, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in March 2014 would be worth $197,163.86, or a gain of 19,616.39%, as of March 18, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.93% and the price of gold increased 51.71% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.\n\nNVIDIA's Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. The stock has outperformed the industry year to date. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nThe stock is up 20.97% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 15 higher, for fiscal 2024.

The soaring popularity of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT caused the market's demand for new GPUs to outstrip its available supply, and analysts expect the chipmaker's revenue to surge 81% in fiscal 2025 (which ends in January 2025).\n\nNvidia's stock might still have plenty of room to run as the AI market expands, but its stock is getting a bit pricey at 37x forward earnings. With a market cap of $2.3 trillion, Nvidia has already become the world's third-most valuable company after Microsoft and Apple. So it could be tough to replicate its multibagger gains from the past several years.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThat's why many growth-oriented investors are already on the lookout for the \"next Nvidia.\" Could the top candidate for that title actually be its rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which competes against Nvidia in the gaming and data center GPU markets?\n\nThe differences between AMD and Nvidia\n\nAMD is a much smaller company than Nvidia. It only has a market cap of $315 billion, and analysts expect it to generate less than one-quarter of Nvidia's annual revenue this fiscal year. AMD only controlled 19% of the discrete GPU market in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to JPR, while Nvidia held an 80% share. Intel held the remaining 1% share.\n\nAMD usually sells cheaper GPUs than Nvidia, but the latter has also rolled out lower-end chips in recent years to limit the former's gains in the lower-end market. Nvidia also established a strong position in the data center GPU market before AMD.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, AMD competes against Intel in x86 CPUs for PCs and servers. AMD held 35.5% of that market in the first quarter of 2024, according to PassMark Software, while Intel held a 63.4% share.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past eight years, AMD grew its share of the x86 CPU market by consistently selling cheaper, denser, and more power-efficient chips than Intel. It accomplished that by outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing as Intel struggled to upgrade its own internal foundries.\n\nAMD also sells custom APUs (which merge a GPU and CPU) for gaming consoles and notebook computers, as well as programmable chips for various markets. Nvidia sells Arm-based Tegra CPUs for set-top boxes and the Nintendo Switch and offers data center networking products through its Mellanox subsidiary.\n\nSimply put, AMD is a more broadly diversified chipmaker that generated 29% of its revenue from the data center market, 27% from the gaming market, 23% from embedded chips (including its programmable chips), and the remaining 21% from client computing chips (PC CPUs and GPUs) in 2023. In its comparable fiscal 2024, Nvidia generated a whopping 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs and the remaining 22% from other types of chips.\n\nAMD is growing more slowly than Nvidia\n\nAMD's heavy exposure to the PC market, which suffered a major slowdown after the pandemic passed, throttled its growth over the past year. In 2023, its revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 4% and 24%, respectively. By comparison, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS surged 126% and 288%, respectively, in fiscal 2024.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3416, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f111e9e-dc9f-4cd5-a094-5a3a6d037168": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f111e9e-dc9f-4cd5-a094-5a3a6d037168", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/306.html", "file_name": "306.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6459, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5fff740-3f03-4d0e-9627-5c55d845b655", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/306.html", "file_name": "306.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6459, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f3ae0c64b52c0102a294ca5b4a8a0e12a883567713643cdb65d3c0a6ec00e924", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40eda1f0-a960-4902-8099-5d1d1304083b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/306.html", "file_name": "306.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6459, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "1b8cde2e36d298dae2350caa2a524cb2258c87249017b4cdee8e26e7ccb9411e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8444288-7577-4042-a154-94c3813e04b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3070cf3caeb7bce66e274e6ad8144ab533fdd968d851c95fdb486c094111ef9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9455cb4f5af182e577ba4ef591c1cf86eab8cf54b31640b9a5c08d5a015617ab", "text": "In its comparable fiscal 2024, Nvidia generated a whopping 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs and the remaining 22% from other types of chips.\n\nAMD is growing more slowly than Nvidia\n\nAMD's heavy exposure to the PC market, which suffered a major slowdown after the pandemic passed, throttled its growth over the past year. In 2023, its revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 4% and 24%, respectively. By comparison, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS surged 126% and 288%, respectively, in fiscal 2024. That growth was entirely driven by its brisk sales of data center GPUs, which offset the slower growth of its PC-oriented chips.\n\nAMD has been expanding into the data center market with its own AI-oriented Instinct GPUs, and CEO Lisa Su recently said those deployments were \"accelerating\" and on track to become the \"fastest revenue ramp of any product\" in its entire history.\n\nAMD plans to carve out its own niche in the data center market with those cheaper GPUs and can bundle them with its Epyc data center CPUs and programmable chips. It probably won't overtake Nvidia in the AI race, but many major companies -- including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise -- have already been installing AMD's chips as a cost-efficient alternative to Nvidia's chips.\n\nAnalysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 14% and 37%, respectively, in 2024 as the PC market stabilizes and its data center business expands. In 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 26% and 51%, respectively.\n\nIt could still have a bright future\n\nAMD seems a bit pricier than Nvidia at 58x forward earnings, and its near-term growth will rely more on the PC market than the data center market. It will also remain an underdog in the GPU and CPU markets -- instead of leading those two markets like Nvidia and Intel. AMD is still a promising semiconductor play, but its broader diversification, slower growth rates, and lower market share should prevent it from becoming the \"next Nvidia\" over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Taiwan Stock Exchange now sits just beneath the 19,860-point plateau although it's expected to open in the green on Wednesday.\n\nThe global forecast for the Asian is positive ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement later today. The European and U.S. markets were up and the Asian bourses are expected to open in similar fashion.\n\nThe TSE finished slightly lower on Tuesday following weakness from the steel and cement companies, while the financials and stocks were mixed.\n\nFor the day, the index dipped 22.60 points or 0.11 percent to finish at 19,857.20 after trading between 19,762.16 and 19,921.25.\n\nAmong the actives, Cathay Financial collected 0.42 percent, while Mega Financial dropped 0.99 percent, CTBC Financial improved 0.79 percent, First Financial fell 0.36 percent, Fubon Financial added 0.43 percent, E Sun Financial perked 0.19 percent, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company dipped 0.26 percent, United Microelectronics Corporation spiked 2.32 percent, Largan Precision tumbled 1.79 percent, Catcher Technology rose 0.23 percent, MediaTek retreated 1.71 percent, Delta Electronics surged 4.58 percent, Novatek Microelectronics declined 1.49 percent, Formosa Plastics sank 0.88 percent, Asia Cement slumped 1.34 percent, Taiwan Cement skidded 0.95 percent, China Steel was down 0.21 percent and Hon Hai Precision and Nan Ya Plastics were unchanged.\n\nThe lead from Wall Street is upbeat as the major averages opened mixed on Tuesday but trended upward throughout the day and finished in the green.\n\nThe Dow jumped 320.33 points or 0.83 percent to finish at 39,110.76, while the NASDAQ rallied 3.34 points or 0.39 percent to close at 16,166.79 and the S&P 500 gained 29.09 points or 0.56 percent to end at 5,178.51.\n\nThe strength that emerged on Wall Street reflected a rebound by Nvidia (NVDA) after the company unveiled its latest line of AI chips; the company has lately been a key driver of market activity.\n\nTraders also continue to look ahead to the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated monetary policy announcement. The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, but the central bank's accompanying statement could have a significant impact on the outlook for rates.\n\nOn the U.S. economic front, the Commerce Department noted a substantial rebound in new residential construction in the U.S. in February, while building permits also bounced higher.\n\nCrude oil futures settled higher on Tuesday, rising for a second straight day as traders continued to assess the impact of Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries.

Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) are among the biggest players in this space. NDVA, in particular, has been on a tear recently, as the graphics processing units it specializes in are especially useful in AI applications. INTC is more of a stalwart in the industry but has remained relevant since its founding in 1968. Which of the two is the better investment? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nFind Out: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\n\nRead More: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\n\nQuality\n\nWhile both companies are huge and likely to be financially stable, that doesn\u2019t mean they are on equal footing. The Altman Z-Score is a financial measure used to determine the bankruptcy risk of a business \u2013 both NVDA and INTC have a Z-score high enough to garner a \u201csafe\u201d rating. Both companies also have about $7 billion in cash on their balance sheets. However, given that NVDA\u2019s market cap is significantly higher, this indicates that INTC probably has a safer balance sheet.\n\nEdge: INTC\n\nGrowth\n\nA company\u2019s future growth prospects are another important factor to consider before investing. You might expect NVDA to be the clear winner here, as its recent performance has been so impressive, and INTC is no longer considered a growth company \u2014 but that kind of outperformance is hard to maintain. Analysts expect NVDA to grow at about 36% per year over the next five years, which is certainly above average. However, analysts expect INTC to grow by 43% per year over the same period. Surprisingly, it looks like INTC has the best growth prospects in the near to mid-term.\n\nEdge: INTC\n\nValuation\n\nProbably the most important consideration when analyzing an investment is valuation \u2013 at the end of the day, the price you pay determines your return. Even an amazing business can be a bad investment at the wrong price. The most commonly used metric for publicly traded stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The lower the ratio, the cheaper the stock, and all other things are equal. You might guess that high-flying NVDA is more richly priced than INTC, but this is another surprise. INTC is trading at a trailing twelve-month P/E ratio of 111.3 as of 3/6/24, while NVDA is trading at 74.6 over the same period. It\u2019s worth noting that INTC is in the middle of a turnaround effort, so the market is pricing in the prospect of better earnings in the near future \u2013 nevertheless, NVDA appears to be the cheaper stock on paper.\n\nStory continues\n\nEdge: NVDA\n\nThe Winner: INTC\n\nArguably, NVDA has the brightest future of the two stocks \u2013 but again, it\u2019s important to remember that just being a good business doesn\u2019t make a stock a good investment. When a company has gone through a major growth run, it can often counterintuitively become a risky investment. In this case, INTC looks like the safer choice. However, things can change fast in the stock market, so be sure to re-evaluate your investments regularly.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Nvidia vs. Intel Stock: Which Is a Better Investment?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3367, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "740e0b7b-9cff-46c7-a783-d539139ec217": {"__data__": {"id_": "740e0b7b-9cff-46c7-a783-d539139ec217", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/31.html", "file_name": "31.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4797, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87e858d8-0c9e-4698-92c4-429398f73f05", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/31.html", "file_name": "31.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4797, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "177b9ef35e49f88bd886cdc20bce8129885e4993a46e1e8a611f91bef86caed1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "637abf6c-74c5-4e92-b4f0-a3f4cf9a6f7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/308.html", "file_name": "308.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3399, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "2f05b677a81471ba952651a79a114e6b05b07035eae45634e0b011edf2c6df55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9603388e-4ae8-4141-8b77-01b72fccf916", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d68e46476cbd72810e5fdbea2adffc7506460dedf100062494443451ed394f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5fb317f59d35673226292ae312ec23156be888e410c29df7b02fd1d02aef6d31", "text": "Oracle ORCL and NVIDIA NVDA have announced an extended collaboration to provide sovereign artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to customers worldwide.

The \"Magnificent Seven\" dominated the stock market in 2023.\n\nAn evenly divided basket of the group of elite tech stocks that includes Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla would have jumped an incredible 111% last year, and every one of those stocks gained at least 48% in 2023.\n\nHowever, this year, this group of elite tech stocks suddenly doesn't look so magnificent. As the following chart shows, the performance of most of these seven stocks is more middling so far this year.\n\nNVDA Chart\n\nTwo of the stocks on the list, Tesla and Apple, are outright losers so far this year. Tesla's production growth is expected to slow significantly this year amid a challenging market for electric vehicles (EVs), while Apple has faced weak demand in China and its overall revenue growth is near flat.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, has sputtered as the market is skeptical of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot launch, Gemini, and it's losing market share to Meta in advertising. Only Nvidia and Meta, the two best performers on the Magnificent Seven last year, have continued to dazzle the market in 2024.

The AI chip titan is its biggest holding, making up 28% of the total fund. The rest of its top five holdings include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing at 9.7%, Advanced Micro Devices at 5.7%, Broadcom at 5.5%, and ASML Holding at 5%.\n\nHere you can see the performance of all five:\n\nNVDA Chart\n\nNvidia is the clear star of this group as well, but all five of these stocks have outperformed the S&P 500, showing that the AI-focused ETF is more than just Nvidia.\n\nShould you buy the VanEck Semiconductor ETF?\n\nETFs offer a number of benefits, including built-in diversification and rebalancing, taking care of much of the work of monitoring and managing your stocks.\n\nOf course, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF isn't diversified across sector lines, but it does offer exposure to a wide swath of semiconductor stocks. The fund tracks the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, which holds the 25 largest and most liquid U.S. exchange-listed companies in the semiconductor industry.

So far this year, it's also the best-performing stock in the entire index. The winners keep running higher as investors gravitate toward companies that are successfully monetizing artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDespite the company's red-hot returns, there are reasons to believe that Nvidia could grow into its valuation over time. But some investors may want to look outside the tech sector for AI opportunities. That's where GE HealthCare Technologies (NASDAQ: GEHC) and Deere (NYSE: DE) come into play. Here's why Nvidia and these two underrated AI plays could be worth buying now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with following the AI leader\n\nScott Levine (Nvidia): Over the past year, several stocks have emerged as compelling routes to gaining AI exposure. But sometimes it's OK to go with the obvious choice. For investors bullish on the prospects of AI -- and it's hard not to be -- Nvidia is still a great option. Sure, the stock has skyrocketed more than 290% since this time last year, but shares can continue flying higher.\n\nConsider, for example, the valuation of Nvidia's shares. Currently, the stock is trading at 36 times forward earnings. This may seem like a frothy valuation, but it's common for stocks with high expectations surrounding them to trade at such valuations. It may seem counterintuitive to characterize a stock with a market capitalization in excess of $2.3 trillion as a growth stock, but the AI market is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of more than 37% from 2023 to 2030, according to research firm Grand View Research.\n\nWhile Nvidia generates revenue from the gaming and automotive industries, it's the company's data center business that's the cash cow, representing 78% of revenue in fiscal 2024. Because large language models and generative AI programs require colossal amounts of computing power, data centers use Nvidia's chips -- such as its Hopper Tensor Core GPU (graphic processing units) -- to help handle the considerable computing demands placed on them.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia foresees a ripe growth opportunity related to its AI offerings in the form of \"AI factories.\" According to management, these are innovative data centers specifically built for AI purposes such as \"processing, refining, and transforming vast amounts of data into valuable AI models and tokens.\" Nvidia estimates that leading companies will have their own AI factories to support their operations.\n\nDespite the rapid rise in its price, Nvidia's stock doesn't seem to be unattractively valued. The company generates massive amounts of cash -- $26.9 billion in fiscal 2024 -- so its stock is still a great way to quench investors' thirst for AI exposure.\n\nAI is integral to the growth plans at GE Healthcare\n\nLee Samaha (GE HealthCare): Investment in AI continues to be explosive, and the immediate beneficiaries are companies like Nvidia that create the architecture around it. That said, there's a reason why AI investment is exploding, and it comes down to the productivity improvements it generates. That's why the next wave of beneficiaries will be companies that use AI to add value to their solutions for customers.\n\nProductivity improvements are never more important than in the healthcare industry, where huge volumes of important data and information are created that aren't yet being analyzed to the best of their ability.

That's where GE Healthcare, a leading provider of imaging, ultrasound, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and patient care equipment, comes in.\n\nThe company has 58 AI-enabled device authorizations, more than any other medical technology company. Its imaging equipment can be embedded with AI to produce more intelligent systems that quickly and accurately diagnose and predict outcomes. This is a significant plus in a critical-care environment such as intensive care units, emergency departments, or neonatal intensive-care units.\n\nDeveloping and releasing new AI-enabled products is a vital part of GE Healthcare's revenue and margin expansion plans. Indeed, management wasted no time in investing in AI after it was spun off from General Electric in early 2023 with an agreement to acquire Caption Health, a leader in AI applications in ultrasound scans, which was announced in February 2023. Moreover, management recently announced a deal to buy MIM Software, an AI solution provider of analysis for imaging and radiotherapy.\n\nInvestors can expect GE Healthcare to continue adding and developing complementary AI solutions and adding value in the process. That's great news for healthcare providers, patients, and investors.\n\nDeere is playing the long game with AI\n\nDaniel Foelber (Deere): Deere is a good example of a technologically-forward company that often gets overlooked as a top AI player. But investors should be skeptical when it comes to massive industrial companies posing as tech companies.\n\nNot to pick on Honeywell International too much, but it has been touting monetization of the industrial internet of things and automation for several years now, yet its growth has slowed to a sluggish pace.\n\nInvesting in innovation doesn't always translate to a material impact on the bottom line. But Deere is showing that its Smart Industrial strategy, which was introduced in 2022, is helping drive its performance. To quote Deere CEO John May from the Q1 fiscal 2024 earnings call:\n\nAs I think about 2024, it's helpful to consider the smart industrial journey that we've been on, which has been grounded in unlocking incremental value for our customers through technology and enabling Deere to deliver structurally higher financial performance. I'm extremely pleased with how we've executed our production systems approach, centralized and advanced our tech stack and focused on delivering value across the entire life cycle of our solutions, all while allocating capital in a more efficient and strategic manner. Deere's last few years of financial performance are evidence of the structural improvement that comes with executing our strategy, all while delivering better outcomes for our customers.\n\nThis expansion cycle has been particularly sizable for Deere. When plotting a cyclical company's earnings, investors want to see a squiggle line that slopes up and to the right, accounting for downturns and expansions, with each expansion including new highs. Deere's recent expansion was abnormal. Here you can see the company's last 20 years of annual earnings.\n\nDE Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nThere are a few downturns, followed by expansion periods and then boom -- the recent cycle from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023 showcased explosive growth.

The graphics chip giant announced the news during its annual GTC conference in San Jose on Monday.\n\nThe idea is to let developers use Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse tools in an AR/VR setting via the Vision Pro. Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is a platform that allows programmers to create digital twins of objects and locations that they can use to determine how they\u2019ll behave or look in the real world.\n\nNvidia says organizations can use its Omniverse tool to create things like factories in a digital space so that they can understand how workers will move around the facility before they ever put shovels into the ground.\n\nDuring GTC, Nvidia showed how a designer could use a car configuration tool via the Vision Pro to manipulate different aspects of a vehicle and then virtually step into it.\n\nThe company says it\u2019s able to do this via its Omniverse Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, and its Graphics Delivery Network that streams directly to the Vision Pro via the cloud.\n\nA customer uses Apple's Vision Pro headset at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan in New York City, Feb. 2, 2024. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\u201cApple Vision Pro is the first untethered device which allows for enterprise customers to realize their work without compromise,\u201d Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of simulation, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to our customers having access to these amazing tools.\u201d\n\nThe move is a win for both Nvidia and Apple. It ensures that Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is available on Apple\u2019s high-end headset and gives Apple\u2019s Vision Pro another enterprise offering.\n\nApple's $3,499 Vision Pro is too pricy for most consumers, but enterprise customers, for the most part, can more easily swallow that kind of price. Plus, bringing Nvidia's Omniverse technology to the headset makes it a far more attractive purchase.\n\nWhether that means Apple will see a meaningful sales jump, however, remains to be seen. If it does, it could provide a powerful business line for the Vision Pro and Apple's bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nSubscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

Three-year earnings growth expectations among the largest 10 tech stocks were around 15%, lower than the 24% seen during the tech bubble of 2000, while valuations were at 28x earnings, much lower than the 52x seen in 2000.\n\nAlso Read: Biden To Present Intel With CHIPS Act Award, Cementing Arizona As Semiconductor Hotspot\n\nThree Subsequent Phases Of The AI Industry\n\nHammond believed that following the current, first, phase of AI which kicked off in 2023 with the emergence of ChatGPT \u2014 and provided Nvidia with huge profits \u2014 there would be three subsequent phases of the AI trade offering many investment opportunities.\n\nPhase 2 \u2014 Infrastructure: \u201cThis will focus on those companies beyond Nvidia that are involved in the infrastructure necessary to build AI,\u201d Hammond said.\n\nThis phase included other fabless chip designers such as Broadcom Inc AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD, and fab manufacturers like Intel Corporation INTC and GlobalFoundries Inc GFS.\n\nAlso included were manufacturers of chipmaking equipment and data center providers, as well as utilities as the growing demand for chips requires increased electricity.\n\nCloud providers such as Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Amazon.com Inc AMZN would be phase 2 beneficiaries.\n\nLoading...

Demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services is surging along with interest in generative AI.\n\nShares of Nvidia have soared 280% over the last year. Given the unrelenting momentum pushing the stock higher, some investors might be wondering if it's time to take some profits.\n\nLet's dig into the full story surrounding Nvidia to determine if trimming your position makes sense.\n\nNvidia's train is moving at full speed, but...\n\nLast year was a milestone for Nvidia. The company increased its revenue by 126%, all while expanding its margins and increasing cash flow sixfold. With such a dominant performance and an optimistic outlook, it's not surprising that investors have poured into the stock. And to add some color here, Nvidia has added $1 trillion of market cap to its valuation in less than two months.\n\nThat is a rise of epic proportions. Nvidia is now the world's third-most-valuable company, sitting behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe recent momentum pushing shares higher is likely causing some investors to consider taking profits. I don't blame them, but as an investor in Nvidia myself, I'm going to share why I see even better days ahead.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\n...it could easily kick into another gear\n\nInvestors should realize that the majority of Nvidia's growth last year stemmed from its computing and networking business. But outside of GPUs and data center services, it has loads of opportunity.\n\nThe company ended 2023 with $26 billion in cash on the balance sheet, double what it had at the end of 2022. Over the last several months, it has been aggressively investing in new areas in AI that it can use to complement its hardware operation.\n\nSpecifically, Nvidia invested in two different software businesses: voice-recognition company SoundHound AI, and big data analytics start-up Databricks. I see these as particularly savvy moves. AI-powered voice control is an area where many of Nvidia's big tech cohorts have demonstrated an interest.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have all invested in this technology and deployed it across their respective lines of smart-home and personal-computing products. Considering that the addressable market for voice-recognition applications is expected to reach $50 billion by the end of the decade, Nvidia's moves in this lesser-known pocket of AI are understandable.\n\nAnother area where Nvidia is investing is robotics. The company recently joined Microsoft, Intel, and OpenAI in a funding round for Figure AI, which is developing humanoid robots that it plans to commercialize in manufacturing, warehousing, and retailing.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates that humanoid robotics could be a $38 billion market by 2035. Nvidia's GPU hardware coupled with its fast-growing software services business puts the company in a unique position to help move Figure AI's ambitions further along in more ways than one.\n\nIs now the time to take some profits?\n\nAll of the investments outlined above tell me one thing: Nvidia's journey isn't over. The company is planning for the future and is not sitting on its hardware cash cow.\n\nThis is why I am optimistic about the company. Yes, the stock has gone parabolic, and many investors are likely up a significant amount of money.

That new target ranks fourth among those listed on FactSet from analysts who've put out notes in the past month.\n\nSee also: Why Nvidia's explosive stock gains aren't over yet, according to BofA\n\nNvidia \"is many things,\" according to Stein, but a pricey stock isn't one of them. \"Investors who believe NVDA is expensive should consider this,\" he wrote: Nvidia's stock trades at 35 times estimated earnings per share for this calendar year, a multiple he deemed \"cheap\" as it's at the low end of Nvidia's historical valuation range and a sizable discount to high-growth chip peers.\n\nIt's also inexpensive when considering Nvidia has the potential to grow earnings at a compound annual rate of more than 100% from calendar 2022 to 2025, Stein added.\n\nHe sees Nvidia's stock as the best data-center investment, and he said that part of the company's business gets the most focus these days. Meanwhile, the company can also capitalize on artificial intelligence at the \"edge,\" which he calculated as an $81 billion market.\n\n\"Edge AI compute will allow the processing of data where it is observed, sensed, or generated, enabling faster, more secure, more reliable, and less expensive AI inference across a wide variety of devices and applications,\" Stein wrote in a separate report focused on the market opportunity there. The idea is that people will move to perform more AI tasks on computers and mobile phones, though he notes they've already been doing so for years to an extent.\n\nNvidia will be \"an important vendor for AI at the edge,\" Stein wrote, though others including Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Arm Holdings PLC (ARM) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) could benefit as well.\n\nDon't miss: Micron's stock could rocket 60%, says the new biggest bull on Wall Street\n\nElsewhere, HSBC analyst Frank Lee boosted his price target on Nvidia's stock to $1,050 from $880 in a Monday note. \"We are encouraged by Nvidia's AI product roadmap which focuses on moving beyond [graphics processing units] and towards owning the entire value chain,\" he wrote.\n\n-Emily Bary\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Warren Buffett purchased 6.13 Million shares in Q3 2020 for $120 a share. Then, the shares zoomed up to around $400, giving a rather nice gain. But now, Berkshire\u2019s unrealised profits are melting away like tears in rain; to quote Roy Batty.\n\nIt seems to me that Snowflake\u2019s stock price has further to fall given the numerous red flags and rather ugly trends.\n\nThe Technology\n\nPut simply, Snowflake allows companies to place their data into an enormous digital filing cabinet in the cloud. Unlike your standard filing cabinet, Snowflake can grow and shrink depending on what an entity needs. Organisations can store tons of information without needing a load of processing power to retrieve it. This lets an enterprise scale up for large tasks, such as analyzing mountains of data, without impacting everyday tasks.\n\nSnowflake also breaks down barriers between disparate parts of an organisation's data, such as sales records and customer feedback. This lets everyone in a company work together on the same information, which is comparable to accessing files in a shared folder.\n\nSnowflake can also incorporate tools such as ChatGPT, which can act as a super-duper research assistant. Using ChatGPT, users can ask questions about their data in plain English. The Snowflake software helps bridge the gap by translating those questions into a language a computer understands, then analyses the results and explains them in a clear way.\n\nIn short, Snowflake keeps an organisation\u2019s data organized and accessible, making it easier for tools like ChatGPT to unlock valuable insights from it.\n\nA key point to note is that Snowflake\u2019s software is proprietary, that is to say, it is not open source.\n\nRed Flag Number 1\n\nA declining revenue retention rate is a red flag for a business, particularly subscription-based or software-as-a-service companies. It often indicates a weakening ability to retain existing customer revenue. Alternatively, the company may be experiencing problems upselling and cross-selling. If this is happening, it suggests customers aren't seeing enough value in expanding their relationship.\n\nThe downward trend in the revenue retention trend is not a pretty sight for Snowflake investors.\n\nTable of revenue retention (Author produced table)\n\nSuch a declining revenue retention rate can negatively impact a company's financial health in a variety of ways. To begin with, it can lead to decreased revenue growth as an inability to retain existing customer revenue makes it harder to achieve overall growth.\n\nRed Flag Number 2\n\nAs noted, a declining retention rate can result in a fall in a company\u2019s growth trajectory, as the table below illustrates.\n\nQ4 2023 Q 1 2024 Q 2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Revenue Growth YoY 54% 50% 37% 34% 33% Click to enlarge\n\nNaturally, one would expect revenue growth in percentage terms to decline over time. Nevertheless, the horrid direction of the trend is plain for all to see, especially when one compares Q4 2023 to Q4 2024.\n\nRed Flag Number 3\n\nNaturally, many Investors pay particular attention to both customer retention metrics and product revenue growth numbers. It\u2019s no surprise that declines in these numbers can cause stockholders to go all wobbly, the effects of which are typically reflected in a plummeting stock price.\n\nChart of Snowflake price action (SA)\n\nRed Flag Number 4\n\nNegative trends in revenues and retention rates can also imply that a competitor is eating their lunch.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3624, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f230cad8-69e8-4334-8c17-525a83fd55d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f230cad8-69e8-4334-8c17-525a83fd55d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/330.html", "file_name": "330.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8643, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c43238a9-6817-4b09-926a-586d260d2755", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/330.html", "file_name": "330.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8643, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "cc046a8659faed0010202d79c9bf78b7ad5e790526ce24521364b3c4bfff171f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "41938f05-47b3-4448-a3db-d10407b8012b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/330.html", "file_name": "330.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8643, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "2c8d6b6b2691498c7bcda408a3e7ec29a5717dc46f0464f603690b596676e25e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c011bd3b-d645-4f1a-9f8d-05c2b5d8ccf9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f422753a378c4f0df881195ad2cf8f5fbeb4f48b6a57bd71e1f2397cd1fd36a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "945afe586034f6cab1906c88c62525496cba88a7dcb6115df54173cbcf12f614", "text": "Nevertheless, the horrid direction of the trend is plain for all to see, especially when one compares Q4 2023 to Q4 2024.\n\nRed Flag Number 3\n\nNaturally, many Investors pay particular attention to both customer retention metrics and product revenue growth numbers. It\u2019s no surprise that declines in these numbers can cause stockholders to go all wobbly, the effects of which are typically reflected in a plummeting stock price.\n\nChart of Snowflake price action (SA)\n\nRed Flag Number 4\n\nNegative trends in revenues and retention rates can also imply that a competitor is eating their lunch. Well, Snowflake does have an impressive competitor in the shape of privately held Databricks.\n\nAs of today, Snowflake\u2019s website states that the company has 9,437 global customers, whereas, Databricks recently announced that they had more than 10,000 customers. In fact, the number of clients Databricks has signed up has increased by around 100% in a little over 2 years! (More than 5,000 in 2021).\n\nGiven that Databricks is privately held, details of revenue numbers are not easy to obtain. However, some reports claim that Databricks' revenue is estimated to be around $1.275 billion in annual recurring revenue for 2022 and is projected to reach $1.9 billion in 2023, which is a growth rate of 55.3%.\n\nDatabricks Technology\n\nSnowflake was founded in 2012, while Databricks came a year later in 2013. Both are major players in the cloud data space, but with slightly different approaches.\n\nDatabricks differs from Snowflake in a number of important areas. To begin with, Databricks employs open-source tools, such as Apache Spark, which is a super-fast engine that can crunch massive amounts of data. Databricks makes Spark easier to use by sorting out the technical setup.\n\nDatabricks also offers its own open-source tools to help data teams. Delta Lake acts like a filing cabinet, keeping all the data organized and reliable. And MLflow is another tool, but for building and managing artificial intelligence projects, like teaching machines to recognize patterns and the like.\n\nProprietary Tools Or Open Source, That Is The Question\n\nThere is often a battle between proprietary and open-source tools. We are all familiar with the victory of Windows OS over Linux in desktops. However, Linux has become a dominant force in servers and web hosting. It's known for its stability, security, and customizability, rivalling proprietary options like Windows Server.\n\nOften, there are a number of advantages of opting for open-source solutions. For instance, open source generally has a reduced upfront cost, as a result of reduced licencing fees. Then there is typically a large community of developers who may be able to identify and fix bugs faster, or foster faster innovation.\n\nWithout a doubt, both companies have a high quality offering, as evidenced by the Gartner report on the magic quadrant for cloud database management systems.\n\nGartner Magic Quadrant (Databricks' website)\n\nRed Flag Number 5\n\nRecently, Databricks has forged a strong relationship with a key player in the AI sector and has made an acquisition that will give the company a significant advantage over Snowflake.\n\nIn July 2023, Databricks announced that it can complete the acquisition of MosaicML. If you take a look at MosaicML\u2019s website, you can quickly understand that Databricks has gained a significant advantage over Snowflake.

If you take a look at MosaicML\u2019s website, you can quickly understand that Databricks has gained a significant advantage over Snowflake. While ChatGPT and MosaicML are both involved with large language models, they serve different purposes. The MosaicML software platform has been designed to assist with training large language models such as ChatGPT. Furthermore, the platform focuses on making the training process more accessible and efficient for organizations that want to create custom models. That is to say, MosaicML does not compete with ChatGPT, rather it enables ease of use.\n\nOn the 14th September, it was announced that Nvidia had coughed up a big chunk of change to participate in Databricks\u2019 Series I funding, which raised over $500 million. It is evident from the announcement that Nvidia plan to do all the can to ensure that they get a hefty return on their investment. In my view, this cannot be viewed in a positive light by Snowflake stockholders. In the release, you will find the following quotes;\n\nAli Ghodsi, Co-Founder and CEO of Databricks. \"Databricks and NVIDIA are building transformative AI technology, and we're excited about the business value and innovation we can bring to our customers.\"\n\n\"Enterprise data is a goldmine for generative AI,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"Databricks is doing incredible work with NVIDIA technology to accelerate data processing and generative AI models.\"\n\nCaution\n\nThe above represents my view of the company, and of course I could be entirely wrong. This time next year I could be sitting here with copious quantities of egg on my face.\n\nTo begin with, Snowflake could win the proprietary versus open-source contest, resulting in the Snowflake stock price making its merry way to the moon.\n\nNewly appointed CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, whose knowledge and experience of all things AI is extensive, may build a team of specialists that construct a platform that can overtake Databricks.\n\nSummary\n\nSnowflake is facing numerous serious challenges. Their revenue retention rate is declining, which could hurt future growth. Additionally, competitor Databricks is growing rapidly and has recently acquired technology that could give them an edge.

Investors should monitor a key trendline stretching back to the October 2022 swing low, which may provide near-term support during the stock\u2019s current retracement. Synopsys shares rose 2.5% to $574.74 in extended-hours trading and have gained about 50% over the past year.\n\nAnsys\n\nSource: TradingView.com.\n\nEngineering software maker Ansys announced Monday evening that it plans to increase its collaboration with Nvidia to develop next-generation simulation solutions powered by accelerated computing and generative AI in areas such as accelerated computing, 6G communication systems, AI-infused simulation solutions, and autonomous vehicles. In addition, Nvidia will use Ansys solutions to optimize its hardware and provide the company with its new Blackwell AI chips.\n\nSince gapping above the July 2023 swing high in late December, the Ansys share price has traded within a narrow range to form a descending triangle, In the short-term, the stock looks well supported by a zone of support between the triangle\u2019s lower trendline and the 200-day moving average. A breakdown below this important technical level could see a retest of the prominent October 2023 swing low. Ansys stock increased 1.6% to $340.50 in after-hours trading Monday and is up about 7% over the last 12 months.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Analysts at the firm anticipate positive news from Nvidia at next week's Global Technology Conference (GTC) will boost the stock.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nNvidia usually reveals important news about partnerships and demand trends in the data center market that could be beneficial to the business. Of course, the question is how much growth is already factored into the stock price after surging 590% over the last three years.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to report year-over-year revenue growth of 273% to reach $24.3 billion in the April-ending fiscal first quarter. Earnings per share are expected to grow even faster as strong demand for high-end chips boosts the company's margins. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 74. However, using analysts' earnings estimates for this year, the forward P/E drops to a more reasonable 36.\n\nNvidia stock is expensive, but the business is growing rapidly. There's room for the shares to move higher depending on the company's outlook beyond the next quarter.\n\nThis is why Wedbush might be right about positive news from GTC benefiting the stock. Analysts will be listening to any insights about demand trends for data center products, which made up 83% of the business last quarter.\n\nStill, whatever direction the stock moves in the next few months will pale in comparison to the stock's performance over the next several years. On that note, management sees the data center infrastructure market worth hundreds of billions per year in the next five years, which could support new highs for the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.\n\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\n\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\n\nReal time prices by BATS.

Shutterstock / JRdes\n\nCathie Wood rose to fame thanks to the incredible performance of the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) from 2016 to early 2021. The past three years haven\u2019t been as kind to the ARK Innovation ETF, which still sits 70% below all-time highs reached in early 2021 even as the Nasdaq sets new highs.\n\nOne reason for ARK\u2019s struggles is that the fund sold NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) before its most recent run. Yet, Wood recently doubled down on her firm\u2019s position, comparing NVIDIA to stocks that imploded during the 2000 Internet bubble.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at Wood\u2019s remarks and ARK Innovation\u2019s history with NVIDIA.\n\nCathie Wood Compares NVIDIA to 2000 Era Cisco\n\nThe most recent comments from Wood were in a letter she published on March 7th. The letter is favorable to artificial intelligence as a market but draws a sharp comparison between Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) in 2000 and NVIDIA today.\n\nWood notes how Cisco soared 31-fold in the three and a half years leading up to March 1994, saw a 50% drop, and then went on another 73-fold run that ended with the Dot-Com bust in 2000. She draws a comparison to NVIDIA\u2019s recent run, which is now at 23-fold since the company saw a 56% sell-off in late 2018.\n\nSimply put, Wood sees NVIDIA at a similar place to where Cisco stood in early 2000 before its share price collapsed as it became apparent growth expectations for the company were far too high.\n\nShe says: \u201cWell-funded startups have scrambled \u2013 likely double- and triple-ordering GPUs in the process \u2013 to acquire Nvidia\u2019s hardware and train AI models. Today, Nvidia is guiding expectations to a sequential deceleration in growth and, reportedly, the lead time for its GPUs has dropped from 8-11 months to 3-4 months, suggesting that supply is increasing relative to demand.\u201d\n\nWood goes on to add that without an explosion in software revenue to justify all this GPU capacity, she would expect a pause in spending. Her final point is that NVIDIA could face increased competition as their largest customers (companies like Meta, Facebook, and Google) may simply rely more on AI chips designed in-house.\n\nARK\u2019S History with NIVIDA\n\nBefore evaluating specifics in Cathie Wood\u2019s comments, it\u2019s worth looking at ARK\u2019s history of owning NVIDIA stock.\n\nNVIDIA was one of the ARK Innovation ETF\u2019s largest positions at times, but the fund sold a large position of NVIDIA in November 2022 and completely divested from the company in January 2023. The cited reason for the sale was valuation.\n\nIf we look at November 9th, 2022 as the date ARK sold most most their NVIDIA shares, the stock closed that day trading for $137.76. If Wood had simply held those shares, they\u2019d be up another 537% today.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly striking about ARK\u2019s sale date was it happened in the same month the \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for AI happened. In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, which was a massive move forward in artificial intelligence capabilities and started the demand boom for AI hardware that continues today.\n\nSimply put, it\u2019s not just that ARK sold NVIDIA, it\u2019s that their sales kind of looks like selling Apple in January 2007.\n\nIs Cathie Wood Right About NVIDIA?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3232, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e914980b-1edf-4067-a143-66e0d72aba80": {"__data__": {"id_": "e914980b-1edf-4067-a143-66e0d72aba80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/348.html", "file_name": "348.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8474, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "600ce215-c6d9-4e60-b8c2-bf2310c0ed56", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/348.html", "file_name": "348.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8474, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "ae34bbaac46d54eaa8d5015956a3594e95448b16f47e71fcb62370ba86977e86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ce84ae8-e066-4f2c-8e22-4f518872a142", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/348.html", "file_name": "348.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8474, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "75cdc2e44dce7e35131b91e469abe17bec8158a5b80b331a124980f075c6b55c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4f3b9a6-8151-49fe-9214-353a88dc1b14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c44d199a11a03d7185ab1532516b7e952d9c79f492e25fb5771f242f2e99649", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a854ea6a6c2e7856ca16a06bf2247cdfeadabdd8daa09c500715a743e7edeac0", "text": "If we look at November 9th, 2022 as the date ARK sold most most their NVIDIA shares, the stock closed that day trading for $137.76.

She notes that lead times for NVIDIA\u2019s AI chips are reportedly dropping from 8-11 months to 3-4 months.\n\nIn the days leading up to NVIDIA\u2019s latest earnings report, the stock was selling off in large part due to reports about lead times falling hitting the press. Yet, post-earnings commentary from NVIDIA management and the strength of NVIDIA\u2019s forecast reassured investors that demand was strong, and the stock has continued rallying after earnings.\n\nOne factor that makes reading too much into lead times difficult is that NVIDIA is about to launch a new generation of AI chips. The current boom has seen customers ordering up as many of NVIDIA\u2019s H100 chips as they could get their hands on. However, NVIDIA is readying two new AI chips, the H200 and B100 in the coming months.\n\nThat means that falling H100 lead times could simply be customers waiting to purchase NVIDIA\u2019s newest chips that are readying for launch. Comments from the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) \u2013 the company that manufactures NVIDIA\u2019s AI chips \u2013 also support booming demand for years to come.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s founder said large customers (likely companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta) have approached him requesting the company build up to 10 fabs just to build cutting-edge AI processors. That level of investment in AI manufacturing would be unprecedented (costing hundreds of billions) and shows just how bullish some industry insiders remain.\n\nThe comments from Wood that NVIDIA faces long-term threats also have merit. Their customer base is very concentrated into large \u201chyper scalers\u201d like Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon that would all love to reduce their reliance on NVIDIA.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s easier said than done. But NVIDIA faces the challenge of keeping massive market share in AI chips and maintaining unprecedented margins in the semiconductor space as well. The company reported a staggering 55.6% profit margin last quarter.\n\nWall Street forecasts have NVIDIA returning an absurd 56% profit margin through 2028. Enough competition and pricing power to push this below 50% could cause a sell-off in NVIDIA\u2019s shares.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Bull Case Is the Emergence of AGI\n\nWood finishes her commentary on NVIDIA with an extremely important note. She says: \u201cThat said, since 2019 futurists have collapsed the time to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) from 80 years to 8 years, so anything is possible.\u201d\n\nThis is an extremely important point because the possibility of NVIDIA being the central company to the most important technology trend ever is part of what\u2019s keeping its shares in the stratosphere.\n\nAs a quick example, let\u2019s run a scenario on the value of NVIDIA shares.", "start_char_idx": 2568, "end_char_idx": 6003, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4f3b9a6-8151-49fe-9214-353a88dc1b14": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4f3b9a6-8151-49fe-9214-353a88dc1b14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/348.html", "file_name": "348.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8474, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "600ce215-c6d9-4e60-b8c2-bf2310c0ed56", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/348.html", "file_name": "348.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8474, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "ae34bbaac46d54eaa8d5015956a3594e95448b16f47e71fcb62370ba86977e86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e914980b-1edf-4067-a143-66e0d72aba80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/348.html", "file_name": "348.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8474, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a854ea6a6c2e7856ca16a06bf2247cdfeadabdd8daa09c500715a743e7edeac0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33485156-df92-484e-95a3-11899bbc4df8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e477221ce6c0847e84e90e31d51c2c7e924871129c168b70b70860953591840", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0c44d199a11a03d7185ab1532516b7e952d9c79f492e25fb5771f242f2e99649", "text": "Enough competition and pricing power to push this below 50% could cause a sell-off in NVIDIA\u2019s shares.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Bull Case Is the Emergence of AGI\n\nWood finishes her commentary on NVIDIA with an extremely important note.

And yet, if you add up the probability of each scenario happening multiplied by NVIDIA\u2019s potential value, there is a surprising result.\n\n15% chance X $10 trillion = $1.5 trillion expected value\n\n25% chance X $2 trillion = $500 billion expected value\n\n60% chance X $1 trillion = $600 billion expected value\n\nThe sum of all these scenarios is about $2.6 trillion, which is above NVIDIA\u2019s share price today ($2.2 trillion). Of course, these numbers are more illustrative, but they show the scenarios that may be priced in for NVIDIA.\n\nThe bottom line: the odds are on Cathie Wood\u2019s side that NVIDIA is overlvaued today. However, if she\u2019s wrong she\u2019s going to be spectacularly wrong. That\u2019s a fact she\u2019s all too aware of.\n\nTake This Retirement Quiz To Get Matched With An Advisor Now (Sponsored) Are you ready for retirement?

The company is worth a whopping $2.2 trillion as of this writing, with $1.5 trillion of that value added within the last 12 months alone. Nvidia's recent success boils down to its data center chips designed for processing AI workloads, which continue to attract incredible demand.\n\nBut despite capturing the lion's share of investors' attention, Nvidia isn't the only opportunity in the semiconductor space. According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have a consensus overweight (bullish) rating on two other names: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS).\n\nHere's why owning shares of AMD and Axcelis might be a fantastic idea, too.\n\n1. AMD is emerging as a competitor to Nvidia in data centers\n\nAMD's chips power some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, including Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series X, and even the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles. However, investors' attention is now on the data center.\n\nThe company has begun shipping its latest MI300 lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads -- hardware that competes with Nvidia's industry-leading H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). The MI300 comes in two configurations: The MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to create an accelerated processing unit (APU), whereas the MI300X is a pure GPU.\n\nThe MI300A was selected by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to power its new El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to be the fastest in the world when it comes online this year. However, AMD is also experiencing strong commercial demand for the MI300 range from leading data center operators like Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.\n\nThe MI300 will likely send AMD's data center revenue soaring in the next few years. It won't be easy to catch Nvidia in that segment. However, AMD does have a 90% market share in AI-enabled personal computers. Its Ryzen 700 series (Ryzen AI) chips are designed to handle powerful AI workloads on-device, leading to faster response times for the end user because requests aren't traveling back and forth to the data center.\n\nStory continues\n\nMillions of computers from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus (among others) have already shipped with Ryzen AI chips. In the recent fourth quarter of 2023, Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year. The company plans to launch a new processor, which is up to three times faster than previous iterations, so this business is just getting warmed up.\n\nCombined with a forecast $3.5 billion revenue contribution from the MI300 series in their first full year of sales, 2024 is set to be AMD's biggest year yet. It's no surprise that the majority of the 50 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given AMD stock the highest possible buy rating.\n\n2. Axcelis Technologies is a critical part of the chip fabrication process\n\nAxcelis Technologies isn't a glamorous producer of GPUs like Nvidia or AMD. In fact, it's relatively overlooked, with The Wall Street Journal tracking just eight analysts who cover its stock. Nevertheless, the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating, and it trades at a very attractive valuation right now, which might entice investors to follow the Street's lead.\n\nAxcelis manufactures ion implantation equipment, which is critical to the chip fabrication process.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3495, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "909a4aef-d134-4b8f-9c87-0365ace12598": {"__data__": {"id_": "909a4aef-d134-4b8f-9c87-0365ace12598", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/352.html", "file_name": "352.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6196, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "169c4289-766c-4728-bcb6-e9686306a2f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/352.html", "file_name": "352.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6196, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "b00eef460f56cbbb3b2c67df4fb54134379c128cbf0c7b7a35e5aaf64348946e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d199b3a3-3c28-4c39-a171-4043cd66b8d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/352.html", "file_name": "352.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6196, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d8bd9793108c347fcdf9e4691758f41d3da4631104a24544af8dcb7f81cb0f78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "61413bd2-20c0-4ae2-ac5e-812bf640f011", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f00cac9e31dab733bf8acc3dd95cbcc5fb5b80aaa8e1262f0428e56c1a6ca989", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f82400e5d976bac2a8ecda15695f176213ef1df28903599ef5b08d8012504c9d", "text": "It's no surprise that the majority of the 50 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given AMD stock the highest possible buy rating.\n\n2.

In fact, it's relatively overlooked, with The Wall Street Journal tracking just eight analysts who cover its stock. Nevertheless, the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating, and it trades at a very attractive valuation right now, which might entice investors to follow the Street's lead.\n\nAxcelis manufactures ion implantation equipment, which is critical to the chip fabrication process. Producers of silicon carbide power devices -- which regulate electric power in workloads with high currents -- are a significant source of demand for Axcelis at the moment, thanks especially to the electric vehicle industry. Silicon carbide chemistry is more efficient than traditional silicon chemistry, which leads to more mileage per battery charge and faster charging times.\n\nThe company is also preparing for growing demand from producers of AI-related semiconductors. Last year, the company noted that AI requires significantly more memory and storage capacity, which could make DRAM and NAND chips more complex to manufacture, and more expensive.\n\nAxcelis generated a record $1.13 billion in revenue during 2023, representing a 22.9% year-over-year increase. But here's the kicker: The company ended 2023 with an order backlog worth $1.2 billion, so 2024 is shaping up to be another record year.\n\nThe stock is up over 400% in the last five years, but it has taken a breather over the last few months, suffering a 44% decline from its all-time high. That might spell opportunity, because based on the company's $7.43 in earnings per share in 2023, the stock now trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. That's a 59% discount to the 35.6 P/E ratio of the iShares Semiconductor ETF, so Axcelis' stock is substantially cheaper than the rest of the chip industry, on average.\n\nMoreover, when you also consider Wall Street's bullish stance on Axcelis stock, there is a very clear case for buying it right now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This week marks the largest congregation of central bank decisions in 2024, affecting six of the ten most-traded currencies.\n\nThe stock market has seen a rebound, with the S&P 500 halting a three-day decline, the Nasdaq 100 rising by 1.2%, and a collection of tech megacaps, often referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" climbing over 2%. In the bond market, US two-year yields have reached new highs for 2024, reflecting diminishing expectations for imminent Fed rate cuts. The Japanese yen saw fluctuations following reports that the Bank of Japan might end its yield curve control policy.\n\nWith a packed schedule of central bank meetings ahead, experts from Brown Brothers Harriman, Win Thin, and Elias Haddad, predict a shift from the current calm to potential market volatility. Japan is notably anticipated to make a historic move by ending its negative interest rate policy, a decision that has led to a surge in yen futures positions.\n\nDespite expectations of a shift in the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting timeline due to persistent inflation, Goldman Sachs economists have adjusted their forecast to three quarter-point cuts this year, aligning with the median forecast made by policymakers in December. This adjustment is primarily attributed to a slightly higher inflation path.\n\nInvestors are also focusing on the Fed's dot plot for insights into the expected number of rate cuts this year. The market is eager for reassurances from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that recent inflation data will not derail the Fed's plans, amidst speculation about the potential for a stable financial environment that could bolster equities and provide traditional benefits of fixed income in portfolios.\n\nAs the week unfolds, earnings reports from companies like FedEx Corp. (FDX, Financial), Nike Inc. (NKE, Financial), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU, Financial), General Mills Inc. (GIS, Financial), and Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI, Financial) will offer further insights into the US economic landscape and consumer spending trends.\n\nCorporate updates include Nasdaq Inc.

So this led to continued interest in other companies that can benefit from the AI rally on both the top- and bottom-lines.\n\nFurther, tech giants have been driving the stock market to record highs, leading many investors to question whether this rally is overdone. And while Nvidia has taken a step back, investors can play this rally in plenty of other ways this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three top options I think investors ought to consider, if one is looking to invest in AI related companies. These stocks span the risk spectrum, but each company has unique catalysts that could drive outperformance for the rest of the year.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN)\n\nPerson holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith shares rising over 15% at noon after a previous spike of more than 20%, investors are locked in on SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). March 6, 2024, was the day that saw the stock close at $5.04. That was a staggering 197% jump in just a month. With a $1.24 billion market cap, SOUN remains a small-cap company despite its growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s confidence in its future AI demand is consistent with broader trends. Also, it\u2019s comparable to the success of chip companies like Nvidia. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs fan the flames of AI developments. And the company\u2019s holdings in SoundHound AI shares have something to do with Nvidia-related news. Today, Mizuho upped SoundHound\u2019s stock prices and Nvidia\u2019s price target.\n\nWith Nvidia\u2019s backing, SoundHound AI aims to bring voice recognition technology to uncharted territories. If successful, this stock could be the higher-risk, higher-upside AI stock investors wish they bought on recent dips.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nSign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome may say Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) currently lives in Nvidia\u2019s shadow. That\u2019s generally a statement I\u2019d define as true. However, many investors look for the semiconductor company to continue developing next-generation high-performance chips, thus challenging Nvidia in this arena over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD has announced plans to continue to roll out new chips targeting the AI space. And, while initial revenue estimates are small (relative to Nvidia), it\u2019s unquestionable that if AMD can price its chips correctly, market share gains are on the horizon.\n\nThe company\u2019s enterprise solutions and unique offerings spanning computer and graphics processors provide a diversified model. It\u2019s one that is only strengthened by these AI tailwinds. As the company\u2019s data center segment continues to pump out record revenue, it\u2019s a stock to watch outside of its AI upside. Thus, I think any sort of AI-related premium is a plus for investors. Further, more upside could be on the horizon if the market values this company more as an AI play than a data center play.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR)\n\nPalantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3435, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c4b0bd8-de9c-4dc4-899c-4d0a1420f70f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c4b0bd8-de9c-4dc4-899c-4d0a1420f70f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/356.html", "file_name": "356.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5264, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f473783-a34d-4a59-b036-88a57f989568", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/356.html", "file_name": "356.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5264, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "b7a1d6ebbd7602c5655360a7b7c66236cdd55fe39056a45ff3eeb75ea8aa75f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f36d6da8-b26e-4469-8aa9-726093459401", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/356.html", "file_name": "356.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5264, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "2ef80a83e0a354ed8446cd7a9d071066046213e96c8d93f09d70b7c72a1246cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5764fb05-17ae-43cf-8824-eadcea686407", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "12388d5ef3d334ba70ae3c6c7ff9d6da23a4625583e4d3ed3f2d54875737df54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "af62d456ee5061868e1e189a654af1d1a4e07853f261fc24d5770c4ea4da1eba", "text": "The company\u2019s enterprise solutions and unique offerings spanning computer and graphics processors provide a diversified model.

Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) has gone from meme stock to AI darling. Many (myself included) did not think that its valuation could surge the way it did. However, Palantir has shown robust results, seemingly driven by its early-adopter status in the world of big data and AI-linked systems.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price has continued to remain robust, with PLTR stock still hovering near 52-week highs. The fact that this stock has more than tripled over the past 12 months tells most investors all they need to know about its status as a momentum play.\n\nSince Palantir\u2019s blockbuster results, the stock has found its footing around the $25 level. The company\u2019s impressive Q4 profits, driven by the commercial sector, signal catalysts that could be longer-term in nature than many thought possible. Thus, so long as Palantir continues to pump out consistent GAAP profitability and upbeat projections, it\u2019s a stock AI investors will want to own.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2024-03-18, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $379.69. It's currently trading at a price of $878.365. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -131.34%. The company is significantly overvalued.\n\nNVIDIA Corp: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $12.15 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.31%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 41.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years.

You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\n\nNavigating with GuruFocus:\n\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Yet, SMCI seems to have overplayed its hands today after announcing a new equity offering.\n\nOf course, there is a solid reason behind Super Micro Computer's ongoing affinity with NVIDIA. After all, the company's biggest client is NVIDIA, and its second-biggest client is an entity that is backed by NVIDIA. However, with SMCI shares up over 300 percent so far this year, as of yesterday's closing price, the stock's nosebleed valuation has been a cause of concern for many discerning investors.\n\nSupermicro $SMCI announces public offering of 2mn shares of common stock! $NVDA $AMD $DELL $HPE Super Micro Computer, Inc.

The GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip that combines one Arms-based Grace CPU with two Blackwell B100 GPUs. The system can deploy an AI model with 27 trillion parameters. For reference, OpenAI's GPT-4 has just 1.7 trillion parameters. The chip is expected to be 30 times faster at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. A new server, called the GB200 NVLink 2, that combines 72 Blackwell GPUs with other NVIDIA peripherals designed to train AI models. NVIDIA Inference Microservice, or NIM for short, that forms a part of the company's enterprise software subscription. The software allows subscribers to use NVIDIA's older GPUs for AI inference, a process where trained AI models use new data to draw (or infer) conclusions.

The four-day event, that's been called the Woodstock of AI, was expected to draw some 300,000 attendees live or online.\n\nHuang focused on Nvidia's new generation of chips and the two factors that make AI work:\n\nThe training (or programming) to enable the semiconductors to receive data, recognize and organize it and send it back out to a client in usable form.\n\nThe brute computing power to make it all happen.\n\nNvidia's influence on artificial intelligence is already substantial thanks to its H100 GPU chips and related products, which power most AI applications now.\n\nMaking chips so powerful they can think\n\nThe Blackwell platform, expected to be available toward the end of 2024, will use a new series of chips, the B200 family, combined with new components and software to get the most out of the chips.\n\nThe goal is to let a user pack more training onto chips so they and the components built around them can recognize data more quickly.\n\nAs important, the chips are supposed to access more inference \u2014 the capacity to know how analyze the data to produce usable conclusions to queries and questions.\n\nRelated: Analysts revamp Eli Lilly stock price target on weight-loss drugs\n\nBlackwell is supposed to offer 4 times the capacity of Nividia's wildly popular A100 chip to program the training aspects in the chips themselves and 30 times the inference output.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdd more of these chips into the system, and you can gather more data and translate it into more usable information almost instantaneously.\n\nWho would use the new chips\n\nTo that end, Nvidia is developing other equally fast components into the platform system so that the information flows in and out swiftly and, as important, smoothly, all the while using a lot less power.\n\nA human and an AI-powered robot ahead of a meeting Shutterstock\n\nWhich means, if you're building a self-driving car, you can theoretically load more data into the chips helping to drive the vehicle so that it performs more safely and reliably.\n\nSo, automakers, already hard-at-work at developing safe and reliable self-driving vehicles, would be very interested in the potential of the units.\n\nOther uses include systems that can help warehouses operate more efficiently.\n\nSurgeries, using equipment being developed using Nvidia chips by the MedTech business of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , could be done with fewer medical errors.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nCorporations like German software maker SAP SE (SAPGF) could help its core customers \u2014 big companies with massive, cumbersome amounts of financial, sales and human resources \u2014 do their jobs more efficiently.\n\nRobots could be built to mimic more closely human activities and thereby take over common tasks many of don't want to do.\n\nThe two-hour presentation to the crowd of tech developers and business executives, including Michael Dell of Dell Technologies (DELL) ended with a big round of applause. (Dell's company is a key player in data-center technology.)\n\nThe stock opened up as much as 5.2% after Monday's open but slid to $885.55, up just 0.7%.

The announcement, made during Nvidia's developer's conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.\n\nNvidia's share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAI's ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidia's high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.\n\nThe new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of \"Hopper\" H100s and similar chips.\n\n\u201cHopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the company's developer conference in California.\n\nNvidia shares fell more than 1% in extended trading on Monday.\n\nThe company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.\n\nNvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.\n\n\"Blackwell's not a chip, it's the name of a platform,\" Huang said.\n\n\"The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways,\" said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. \"Of course, we still do that. But what's really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.\"\n\nDas said Nvidia's new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidia's GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.\n\n\"If you're a developer, you've got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, we'll make sure that it's runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people,\" Das said.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2464, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e06fe62-d633-4b07-aa67-544237360523": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e06fe62-d633-4b07-aa67-544237360523", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/399.html", "file_name": "399.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 16647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19aee306-b44d-4319-8864-e954a7e3c609", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/399.html", "file_name": "399.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 16647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "8976a89a409579dba3bf0bfbab00193b909b6f3014beae08c74e1f3735cc17ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "88d69115-20a8-41db-80e3-5e64c9e11732", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/398.html", "file_name": "398.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2468, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d96bff6318448314f9fcf9c631aa4d1572fad63a6e109f631c0bff8249e1e7e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2770cb39-52d8-40a7-af4c-2aef236aca86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d7ba69b48dda71a183d309425a562bda926f7d0b421cbf1ab70df055a5c9403", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "65b97379aff2f02cde15f6237d73eb5a829d7f24e065d145b0f2a70c45575bfa", "text": "In this article, we discuss the 15 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on the cryptocurrency industry, head directly to 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant turnaround from the losses of 2022 and 2023, with a notable rise driven by Bitcoin. Bitcoin's price has been steadily climbing since October 2023 and is currently approaching its previous record levels from late 2021. The surge in prices suggests that the cryptocurrency market may be on track to set new records this year. The key question now is whether this trend signifies a sustained bull market in cryptocurrencies or a short-lived surge. This upward trend follows a surge of interest from retail investors in spot Bitcoin ETFs. For instance, on March 4 alone, net inflows into the US-based Bitcoin ETFs reached approximately $562 million, as reported by Cointelegraph.\n\nThe rising popularity of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum is anticipated to drive market growth in the coming years. People in developed nations are increasingly embracing the convenient and flexible nature of digital transactions offered by these currencies. This surge in virtual currency usage has prompted central banks to show support for digital currencies. Additionally, digital currencies often leverage blockchain technology to achieve decentralization and facilitate efficient transactions, which are fast, transparent, secure, and reliable. Companies are capitalizing on these advantages by investing in cryptocurrency and forming partnerships to enhance services for users. For example, in October 2018, the Qtum Chain Foundation, based in Singapore, collaborated with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s Amazon Web Services China to deploy blockchain systems on the Amazon Web Services cloud. This strategic partnership aimed to simplify the development and deployment of smart contracts for AWS users using Amazon Machine Images.\n\nStory continues\n\nA recent report suggests that Bitcoin may hit a new record of $88,000 in 2024, settling at around $77,000 by year-end. Finder, a UK fintech firm, conducted a study based on predictions from 40 crypto industry specialists. The experts anticipate an average peak price of $87,875 in 2024, with some predicting it could reach $200,000. Conversely, the lowest expected price by the end of 2024 is around $35,734, with a few forecasts of as low as $20,000. Over half of the surveyed experts expect prices to rise after a \"BTC halving event\" in April 2024, where the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is halved. This reward could decrease to 3.125, leading to a decrease in supply and potentially higher prices.\n\nSome experts believe Bitcoin faces pressure due to the halving event and increasing interest from major companies and institutional investors, which could drive up demand. The approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to bring more buyers into the market, as it makes trading Bitcoin-related investment funds easier on US stock exchanges. Additionally, analysts anticipate that a cut in the historically high benchmark rate by the US Federal Reserve could lead to more liquidity flowing into Bitcoin, further boosting its price. However, John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, remains cautious, viewing cryptocurrency as primarily speculative in nature. He stated:\n\n\u201cIf the new spot Bitcoin ETFs are popular, there could be a temporary price increase.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3535, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2770cb39-52d8-40a7-af4c-2aef236aca86": {"__data__": {"id_": "2770cb39-52d8-40a7-af4c-2aef236aca86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/399.html", "file_name": "399.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 16647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19aee306-b44d-4319-8864-e954a7e3c609", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/399.html", "file_name": "399.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 16647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "8976a89a409579dba3bf0bfbab00193b909b6f3014beae08c74e1f3735cc17ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e06fe62-d633-4b07-aa67-544237360523", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/399.html", "file_name": "399.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 16647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "65b97379aff2f02cde15f6237d73eb5a829d7f24e065d145b0f2a70c45575bfa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed80813c-cf50-400c-813a-28d4e52326a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb6048ac0afa983fd0b314b938ba321c84d2ab049497aa0fc373898d508dfbba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0d7ba69b48dda71a183d309425a562bda926f7d0b421cbf1ab70df055a5c9403", "text": "Some experts believe Bitcoin faces pressure due to the halving event and increasing interest from major companies and institutional investors, which could drive up demand.

However, John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, remains cautious, viewing cryptocurrency as primarily speculative in nature. He stated:\n\n\u201cIf the new spot Bitcoin ETFs are popular, there could be a temporary price increase. But, in the medium to longer-term, I still regard Bitcoin as a speculative bubble.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the global blockchain market was valued at about $7.4 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach over $94 billion by the end of 2027, with a projected compound annual growth rate of approximately 66.2% during the period from 2022 to 2027.

Loading...\n\nIn a recent interview, NVIDIA Corp NVDA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that the current \u201cAI computing ramp\u201d is just the beginning and is expected to continue for several years.\n\nWhat Happened: Huang shared his thoughts on the future of AI computing with CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer on Tuesday. He suggested that the AI computing industry is still in its early stages and is likely to see significant growth in the coming years, particularly in sectors like healthcare, reported CNBC.\n\n\"We're in the beginning of this AI computing ramp,\" Huang said. \"And we're in the beginning of the accelerated computing ramp. It's going to last a few years.\"\n\nHe also highlighted the potential of AI in driving innovation across various industries, particularly in healthcare and scientific research. Huang emphasized the role of AI in accelerating the development of new treatments and reducing the need for extensive lab testing.\n\nDiscussing Nvidia\u2019s customer base, Huang noted that the company\u2019s technology has significantly improved data processing speed and reduced costs for its clients.\n\n\"We created a brand-new way of doing computing,\" Huang said. \"Our technology is integrated into all these computer makers, and the world connects it together, and that's the reason why Nvidia is everywhere. We're in every cloud, every data center.\"\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Mixed Amid Wider Correction: Analyst Predicts King Crypto Could Rally To $160K Based On A Technical Indicator\n\nWhy It Matters: Huang\u2019s comments come at a time when Nvidia\u2019s AI technology is gaining significant attention. The company recently unveiled its new AI graphics chips, Blackwell, at a San Jose, California conference. These chips are crucial for training and deploying large AI models and are in high demand by major players in the tech industry.\n\nDespite facing some challenges, Nvidia\u2019s stock has been performing well. The company\u2019s market rally has pushed the value of AI-themed ETFs traded in the U.S. to $6.88 billion, a significant increase from $2.55 billion a year ago. Investors are still exploring the potential of this emerging category, and Nvidia\u2019s continued success in the AI sector is likely to drive this trend further.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, some concerns have been about Nvidia\u2019s future. The company\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently clarified that Nvidia is not just a chipmaker but an accelerated computing company, addressing concerns about the company\u2019s future in the face of increasing competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Cramer has also highlighted several lesser-known Nvidia partners that could benefit from the company\u2019s advanced AI technology, presenting new opportunities for investors.\n\nRead Next: This Could Be A Gamechanger For Natural Gas In Europe\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

All told, the universe of AI-themed ETFs traded in the United States has soared to $6.88 billion as of the end of February from $2.55 billion a year earlier, Morningstar data showed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still so early in the evolution of this category \u2026 that investors are still sorting through the possibilities,\u201d said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares.\n\nThe exuberance surrounding AI funds echoes previous waves of investor excitement for other technologies viewed as transformative, from dotcom stocks to electric vehicles.\n\nEach wave introduced major new businesses to the economy and generated astonishing wealth for founders like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as well as ordinary investors. At the same time, many of the companies whose shares soared in previous market booms eventually saw their stock prices fizzle, a fate that may await some of the market\u2019s current AI favorites.\n\nFor now, investors are responding with enthusiasm and Nvidia \u2013 whose chips are seen as the gold standard in AI \u2013 continues to grab the spotlight.\n\nThe assets of the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which seeks to deliver twice the daily return of the chipmaker\u2019s shares and is not included in Morningstar\u2019s data on AI-themed funds, doubled to $2 billion earlier this month. Those flows have followed the nearly 80% climb in Nvidia\u2019s shares so far this year, after the company\u2019s shares tripled in 2023.\n\nAt its developer conference on Monday, the company unveiled the Blackwell B200, an AI chip it says is up to 30 times speedier than its previous chip.\n\nSmaller ETFs have also prospered. Assets in the Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF tripled to about $20 million from $7.5 million earlier this month, said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs.\n\nSeven of the 18 diversified AI-related ETFs that Morningstar tracks have launched within the last three years. An eighth was redesigned to target AI more directly.\n\nThe funds have had collective inflows of $2.68 billion in the last 12 months, according to Morningstar. That is almost double the inflows into global real estate ETFs, the company said.\n\nWhether investor excitement about the possibilities of AI is fueling a bubble or just contributing to a strong bull run in stocks is unclear.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 8% year-to-date, fueled in part by rallies in AI beneficiaries such as Nvidia and Microsoft, following a 24% gain last year. The AI fervor has also driven parabolic moves in the shares of other companies, including a more than 250% gain in Super Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 this week.\n\nSome investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves. ETF issuer Global X found that its Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF, which caps Nvidia exposure to 3%, has tripled in size over the last three months.\n\nBy comparison, its Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has more than 20% of its assets invested in the chipmaker, grew by 20%.\n\nOthers are focused on finding new areas that will benefit from AI, said Rene Reyna, head of thematic ETF strategy at Invesco and manager of the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3577, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "217e4ae5-1386-4d05-a687-410199515393": {"__data__": {"id_": "217e4ae5-1386-4d05-a687-410199515393", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/401.html", "file_name": "401.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5020, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03edeb57-b3ea-44f2-b560-12f9a42cbdd8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/401.html", "file_name": "401.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5020, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "71d407472f955e154055e1a40663538dde42fdc908a5fc2e19ff0e5c99def5b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "068f6b53-948a-4bdb-8759-a697960b2085", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/401.html", "file_name": "401.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5020, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "54f06a9070f2a28432497277f5448dbc04a444aac1be2c535bbc29026bcd12e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bff0be5b-50eb-4832-8c10-df5818295b5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f82cf1613e8dcb7a76a66a177d7dd348256d5ff152440fbe5798234be222f1ac", "text": "Some investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves.

Less obvious beneficiaries included Walmart and Caterpillar. The bank also recommended exploring \u201cless crowded sub-themes\u201d like the integration of AI and smartphones.\n\nETFs are also scrambling to provide offerings for every taste. Robo Global Robotics & Automation ETF supplements its Nvidia exposure with holdings in stocks some expect to benefit from AI technology, like Intuitive Surgical. The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF is focusing on companies it expects to be beneficiaries of generative AI, including Salesforce.com and Marvell Technology.\n\nStill, at least one flavor of AI-themed ETF has failed to win fans. The WisdomTree US AI Enhanced Value ETF, which uses AI to select its portfolio, has seen outflows of $48.26 million in the last 12 months and lags the S&P 500.\n\nOne possible reason the fund and others in its category have underperformed: many of them lack a position in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)", "start_char_idx": 2976, "end_char_idx": 4986, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bff0be5b-50eb-4832-8c10-df5818295b5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bff0be5b-50eb-4832-8c10-df5818295b5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/405.html", "file_name": "405.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f02ab75f-0855-4d8d-9b56-835ed93421c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/405.html", "file_name": "405.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d9a6694024019034bc87419f6b39ef3e4653cd44c6f606dc126c53cacdc292e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "217e4ae5-1386-4d05-a687-410199515393", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/401.html", "file_name": "401.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5020, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f82cf1613e8dcb7a76a66a177d7dd348256d5ff152440fbe5798234be222f1ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4b4581f-138e-46be-81b4-a58fbdf378a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "238aa95acacebe5867308d2bde025b10fd938f1e0865a659e524ef3039d6d1d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "text": "", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4b4581f-138e-46be-81b4-a58fbdf378a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4b4581f-138e-46be-81b4-a58fbdf378a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/409.html", "file_name": "409.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4913, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "56cf7962-0ce2-438d-9dd4-83427f9f9e67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/409.html", "file_name": "409.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4913, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "58bfc522c035d004690b983db2c0333334b799df71faf0ccdbcc17a8534cd83a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bff0be5b-50eb-4832-8c10-df5818295b5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/405.html", "file_name": "405.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9914fa25-3f69-4401-a61b-3b96c9fe8cb2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d2ae59b652c457703ae136f297f0c8c2e32c21598702d4d6cd7d9a9609373ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "238aa95acacebe5867308d2bde025b10fd938f1e0865a659e524ef3039d6d1d7", "text": "Loading...

Early Monday, stock futures showed mostly upward movement, with the tech sector potentially leading the way.

Parallels that make some investors nervous today.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).\n\nBut as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today\u2019s market isn\u2019t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.\n\nHow can I say such a thing?\n\nIt\u2019s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nBack then, besotted people (I wouldn\u2019t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.\n\nWhy were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn\u2019t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.\n\nSo people who had bought into the dot-com hype \u2014 and there were plenty of them \u2014 mostly bought individual stocks.\n\nThese days, people talk \u2014 mistakenly, in my opinion \u2014 about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst.\n\nPets.com, the leading online pet retailer, announced Nov. 7, 2000, that it was closing down and laying off more than 250 of its 320 employees after being unable to find a purchaser or a financial backer for the company. (Newsmakers) (Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That\u2019s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.\n\n(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced \u2014 on Mar. 10, 2000 \u2014 the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.\n\nThen the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.\n\nUltimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn\u2019t score another new high until April 23, 2015 \u2014 more than 15 years after the previous peak.\n\nEven one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble \u2014 Cisco Systems \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.\n\nBarring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now?

Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday\u2019s close \u2014 the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P\u2019s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)\n\nThe point here is that it doesn\u2019t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren\u2019t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.\n\nLook. I\u2019m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days \u2014 it\u2019s not cheap by any standard. And I\u2019m not telling you that it\u2019s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.\n\nBut what I am telling you is that there\u2019s a big difference between a high-priced market like today\u2019s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nThere may be some difficult times ahead for investors. But a decline of almost 80% over the next two and a half years? As we say in the part of the world in which I live: fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nAllan Sloan is an award-winning journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "start_char_idx": 2723, "end_char_idx": 5883, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3aec98a6-f8bd-4846-8d3f-56da4167a009": {"__data__": {"id_": "3aec98a6-f8bd-4846-8d3f-56da4167a009", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/412.html", "file_name": "412.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 1518, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f20d89dd-492f-4a00-a458-7fcc241e2deb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/412.html", "file_name": "412.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 1518, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "1e8c05e2b0a80909f1ee34d53daaab9d2c90159d786e07b5830dfef494b0709e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "980345ba-0536-42d1-bcd1-8077f7e432de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/411.html", "file_name": "411.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5971, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "2f0cdd5de21d3c08075774518f31cc1750ddf6620f1274cb043356be732e86a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a686905-c1c7-44f1-b9fc-03b03bf8c63d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "093b0eca5cbeea0d187c86b545e6917a40b691eec8d523a45ce11c59af78cab9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1bd5d1166f0e3e62186cfc81c0d0096b8b5ad33ba3e338d64f9d175d3b1cb6e1", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday said he believes Nvidia will revolutionize enterprise.\n\n\"The sum of all that Nvidia's doing will indeed create the next industrial revolution, because Nvidia's about the speed with which we can arrive at smarter, better answers,\" he said after attending the first day of the company's conference in San Jose.\n\nCramer reaffirmed his belief that the company is worth its $2.2 trillion valuation.

It is a sign that traders have grown slightly more apprehensive about the prospect of a selloff in stocks.\n\nBut only modestly so, as the shift has caused skew on S&P 500 index options to rise from around its flattest level on record to the 6th percentile relative to history, McElligott said in a note shared with MarketWatch on Tuesday.\n\nIn options-market parlance, skew measures demand for put options relative to call options, or demand for out-of-the-money calls or puts vs. contracts that are trading at the money, or closer to it. An options contract is said to be \"in the money\" if it can be exercised for a profit. When skew is flat or flattening, it means demand for calls is rising relative to demand for puts.\n\nThe concept is rooted in the notion that puts typically trade at a premium to calls, since volatility tends to rise more rapidly when stocks fall than when they rise. Puts give the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a set \"strike price\" by a certain date. Calls give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy.\n\nTraders, however, have challenged the conventional wisdom this year as stocks have been more volatile on up days than on down days, according to data from Cboe Global Markets, one of the biggest U.S. options exchange operators.\n\nSee: Stocks are taking the elevator up and the escalator down, which is very unusual\n\n\"... [W]e actually saw index hedges being [bought] in recent sessions on this increasing 'un-ease' in the market,\" McElligott said in written commentary shared with MarketWatch on Tuesday.\n\nA similar pattern has played out in options tied to single stocks and popular index-tracking exchange-traded funds, according to data from Spotgamma, a firm that provides data and analytics on the market for U.S. equity options.\n\n\"A month ago there were heavy call skews broadly across tech, including major ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM), Mag 7, software, semis, crypto, etc.,\" said Brent Kochuba, founder of Spotgamma, in comments emailed to MarketWatch.\n\nThe tickers mentioned by Kochuba refer to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF SPY, which tracks the S&P 500, the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq-100, and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, which tracks the small-cap Russell 2000. The Magnificent Seven, meanwhile, refers to a group of megacap technology stocks that drove the bulk of the S&P 500's advance last year.\n\nIt includes shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Tesla Inc. and Alphabet Inc.

AMD already showcased the MI300 chip series targeting Nvidia, with MI309 tailored for China.\n\nOn the other hand, estimates for Nvidia continue to soar, fueled by exceptional performance forecasts, with the company\u2019s revenue anticipated to jump 80% this fiscal year. It is a fund manager\u2019s favorite stock as they see adequate room for growth.\n\nWall Street identifies Nvidia as the leading near-term winner in AI, citing its AI momentum into 2024 and 2025 with the GH200, B100, and B200, projecting Data Center revenues of approximately $89 billion in 2024 with potential for further growth.\n\nLoading...

Now the server maker plans to capitalize by conducting a stock offering.\n\nThe company plans to offer 2 million shares of its common stock in a public offering, it said in a Tuesday morning release. The underwriter, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), is expected to have a 30-day option to purchase up to 300,000 additional shares.\n\nShares of Super Micro (SMCI) are falling 10% in morning trading Tuesday.\n\nDon't miss: Super Micro's stock surge means even the biggest bulls don't foresee huge gains\n\nThe company has a close relationship with Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and it's been posting eye-popping sales growth on its own lately, establishing itself as one of the true financial winners of the artificial-intelligence rush so far. Super Micro closed with a valuation near $56 billion Monday, which marked its first day as a component of the S&P 500 SPX.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to triple its March-quarter revenue total from a year earlier, and Wall Street has been excited about the company's liquid-cooling technology, which is seen as helpful given how power-intensive AI workloads can be. Analysts also praise the company's building-block architecture, which makes it easier for customers to adapt.\n\nBut Super Micro also faces growing competition. The company earned a mention in Nvidia's press materials for its GTC keynote that took place late Monday, but rival Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) arguably got more attention, as Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang gave a friendly shoutout to Dell CEO Michael Dell and had the camera pan to him during his speech.\n\nSee also: Nvidia reveals highly anticipated Blackwell chip lineup at GTC, but stock dips\n\nSuper Micro's Tuesday announcement of its proposed stock offering comes after the company said in late February that it would do a $1.5 billion convertible-debt deal.\n\n-Emily Bary\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations.

In his view, Powell will probably express \"a willingness and desire\" to reduce the central bank's benchmark rate this year, as \"he's so far from equilibrium,\" or a normalized rate, after tightening monetary policy to battle inflation.\n\nWhile markets expect the Fed will announce on Wednesday that it's keeping its benchmark rate at the current 22-year high, traders in the federal-funds-futures market see an almost 56% probability that the Fed could begin reducing rates as soon as June, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, at last check. Traders are pricing in about three rate reductions of a quarter percentage point each in 2024, with chances of fewer cuts than that leaning a bit higher than the probability of more than three by year-end.\n\nInvestors' anticipation for the Fed's release Wednesday of its summary of economic projections is meanwhile running high, as the forecasts will provide a window into whether inflation worries have altered how many rate cuts officials are penciling in this year, after signaling three in December.\n\nProjections for only two rate cuts in 2024 could lead to a knee-jerk reaction of disappointment in markets, according to Rieder, who estimated a 25% to 30% chance of the Fed signaling such a forecast.\n\nRieder said he's also keeping \"a keen eye\" on what the summary of economic projections will show about the longer-run fed-funds rate, which has been estimated at 2.5% in past forecasts.\n\n\"There is a reasonable chance that notches higher,\" he said, which would \"signal higher interest rates for a longer period of time.\"\n\nThe Fed has held its current policy rate at a target range of 5.25% to 5.5% - well above its longer-run projections - in an effort to bring inflation down toward its 2% target.\n\nInflation, as measured by the consumer-price index, increased 0.4% in February for a year-over-year rate of 3.2%, according to a report last week from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.4% last month for an annual pace of 3.8%.\n\nA reading on February inflation from the Fed's preferred gauge, core data from the personal-consumption-expenditures price index, will be released on March 29. Core PCE data showed that inflation rose in January but eased to 2.8% year over year.\n\n\"You have to build into your calculus as an investor\" today that service-level inflation is still too high, Rieder said. By contrast, he said that goods inflation is running at a negative rate after the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening.\n\nRieder worries the central bank's higher rates are putting pressure on lower-income borrowers, local banks and commercial real estate.\n\nThe Fed's rate hikes are becoming a drag on cash-strapped consumers with lower incomes, who are struggling with higher borrowing costs as a result of the tighter monetary policy, he said.\n\nRead: Credit-card and car-loan delinquencies are at their highest point in more than a decade\n\nTodd Vasos, chief executive officer of discount retailer Dollar General Corp.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3852, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54b17999-a748-4e3a-9592-ebc9d8eed91c": {"__data__": {"id_": "54b17999-a748-4e3a-9592-ebc9d8eed91c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/435.html", "file_name": "435.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7039, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3092624b-e1b0-4a12-bbcd-9489098da60e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/435.html", "file_name": "435.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7039, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "de073efa283c081f9521200f5f1d0a273d47dc95c0a84fda19ae978be516cc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "17db4635-c25f-4892-8d05-8d0f8fe7a082", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/435.html", "file_name": "435.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7039, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "4835eb4349a45c775053813b687c39042a5c0db5a46098bf12f4f96b32ecaa00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b74582b-9787-445a-a405-49c14b68335d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37e7c45995a9a49f188a18ab23f6036ce651246769a587ae353c5105bee5f3fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5069afc98369c9766b7b22871b1f01052b7e8c7e62bce0fa90c3d881cd1a4426", "text": "\"You have to build into your calculus as an investor\" today that service-level inflation is still too high, Rieder said.

(NYCB) plunged at the end of January and continued to slide in February before the bank got $1 billion in an equity investment anchored by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's investment firm Liberty Strategic Capital.\n\n'Undue pressure'\n\nInterest-rate increases by the Fed used to have a broader cooling effect before the U.S. economy shifted to become more services-oriented as opposed to manufacturing-based, according to Rieder.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has also become less sensitive to rate hikes when viewed through the lens of the S&P 500, as the widely followed index is heavily weighted in so-called Big Tech companies that have a lot of cash to fund their growth instead of relying on borrowing to do so, he said.\n\nThe evolution of the U.S. economy and markets means the Fed may confront having to make \"more extreme moves to get the benefit\" it's trying to achieve through higher rates, which risks putting \"undue pressure on the parts of the economy\" that are more sensitive to them, according to Rieder.\n\nThe S&P 500 has risen more than 8% this year, driven by outsized gains from a few megacap companies known as Big Tech, including Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), FactSet data show, at last check.\n\nRead: Why S&P 500's consumer-discretionary sector is 'left behind' in U.S. stock market\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX is trading near its record closing peak of 5,175.27 on March 12, even as Treasury yields have climbed this year, according to Dow Jones Market data.

This is not surprising, considering multiple research firms expect the AI market to be worth more than $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nWith the AI trend having the potential to generate windfall returns, investor interest in AI stocks is at an all-time high. Two stocks, namely Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL), can prove to be compelling additions to any AI-focused stock portfolio. Here's why these stocks are smart picks now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWidely known as the poster child of the ongoing AI revolution, semiconductor giant Nvidia is making history in front of our eyes.\n\nNvidia has posted impressive results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Jan. 28, 2024), with both revenue and earnings surpassing consensus estimates. This is an impressive performance, especially since the U.S. government's rising restrictions on chip exports to China may force Nvidia to cancel billions of dollars of chip orders in 2024. Nvidia is also battling competition from other chip players such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as from its key clients who are developing their proprietary AI chips.\n\nDespite this, the technological superiority of Nvidia's AI chips has enabled it to capture nearly 92% share in the global data center GPU market. The company's state-of-the-art GPUs (A100 and H100 chips) and advanced networking technologies (which include the InfiniBand solutions used in high-performance AI infrastructures and the recently launched Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet-based solution for AI-optimized networking) are being used extensively by data centers transitioning their trillion-dollar installed bases from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. Furthermore, enterprises across industries are also leveraging generative AI technologies across use cases, which can also present a trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia's AI-optimized hardware offerings. Plus, the demand for Nvidia's chips is far outpacing supply, which has allowed the company to enjoy significant pricing power -- a key factor driving its solid data center revenue in the past few quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides hardware, Nvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming software stack has been helping clients to optimally program its GPUs for accelerated computing applications. With the increasing adoption of accelerated computing, enterprises also need support to maintain the complex software infrastructure. Since the companies do not have large engineering teams, Nvidia considers this to be a large opportunity for its Nvidia AI Enterprise cloud-native software platform.\n\nWhile Nvidia's growth potential may seem solid, investors are rightly concerned about its sky-high valuation. Trading at 77 times its earnings, Nvidia can be considered to be a very expensive stock. However, this valuation is still cheaper than the company's three-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 95.9 and five-year average P/E multiple of 86.9. Thanks to its cutting-edge offerings, Nvidia has always traded at a solid premium.

Marvell Technology\n\nShares of fabless semiconductor player Marvell Technology dropped nearly 11.4% in a single day after the company released its latest earnings results (Q4 of fiscal 2024 ending Feb. 3, 2024) on March 7. Despite significant weaknesses in other end markets such as carrier infrastructure, enterprise networking, and the consumer market, the AI-driven data center business continues to be a bright spot.\n\nMarvell has been investing aggressively in AI-optimized networking products and chips to benefit from the explosive growth in AI and accelerated computing markets. The company saw solid demand for its high-speed optical interconnect products (100 gig per lane 800 gig PAM products used to move huge amounts of data between chips), accelerators, and switches in traditional cloud data centers and AI-optimized data centers, in the fourth quarter. AI accounted for 10% of the company's data center revenue in fiscal 2024. Marvell expects to deploy its even faster optical interconnect products (200 gig per lane 1.6T PAM solutions) by the end of 2024.\n\nMarvell has also recently announced an extension of its long-standing partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for developing a technology platform capable of producing 2-nanometer chips for accelerated computing. This deal will enable the company to play a pivotal role in improving performance and power efficiency for next-generation AI workloads.\n\nBesides AI, there is also solid growth potential in Marvell's other business segments. While currently in a cyclical downturn, Marvell expects its carrier infrastructure, enterprise networking, and consumer segments to recover gradually in the second half of fiscal 2025. Increasing connectivity and bandwidth requirements in vehicles is also proving to be a major growth driver for the company's automotive business.\n\nConsidering the increasing demand for its AI-optimized networking products and anticipated recovery in other end markets shortly, starting a position in this stock may be a smart move in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, a new report suggests some of this growth might be fueled by reckless speculation.\n\nRisky Bets On A Rising Star?\n\nA Bloomberg report warns that Nvidia\u2019s stock is becoming a playground for \u201cYOLO\u201d traders \u2013 those who embrace high-risk, high-reward bets.\n\nThe report points to a surge in options activity on Monday, with traders snapping up over 24,000 call contracts expiring this Friday (March 22) with a strike price of a staggering $1,940 (nearly double the current price). The small purchase sizes (around 900 contracts each) suggest this is likely retail investor activity, reminiscent of the meme-stock frenzy of 2021.\n\nA call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a stock at a certain price (strike price) by a certain date (expiration date). If the stock price rises above the strike price by the expiration date, the option becomes profitable.\n\nWhile Nvidia, unlike meme stocks, is a well-established industry leader, this buying spree raises concerns about a potential bubble.\n\n\u201cNvidia has been an investor favorite to play the AI trend. We are now also seeing what looks to be retail making some interesting plays while the Nividia AI developer conference goes on this week,\u201d said Michael Beth of WallachBeth Capital LLC, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis comes amidst Nvidia\u2019s GTC 2024 conference, a major AI industry event.\n\nSee Also: Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks\n\nHedging Bets Or Chasing Dreams?\n\nThe report also acknowledges alternative explanations for the options activity. Chris Murphy of Susquehanna International Group suggests it could be a hedging strategy by professional traders. This complex strategy might involve holding short-call options with lower strike prices and offsetting them with these long-shot options.\n\nRegardless of the motivations, the data shows a significant number of call contracts were purchased on Monday, making it the third-most traded contract for Nvidia stock.\n\nLoading...

Nvidia now makes up 5% of the index, and its market cap blasted through the $2 trillion mark, making it worth more than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) for the first time, as shown below.\n\nAMZN Market Cap Chart\n\nNvidia could continue the charge higher. It's a tremendous company (albeit an expensive stock). But investors shouldn't overlook Amazon. Here are my four top reasons why Amazon stock is worth buying like there is no tomorrow.\n\n1. AWS is seeing a resurgence\n\nThere was much handwringing last year as Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth slowed to 13%, after growing 29% in 2022 and 37% in 2021. Revenue eclipsed $90 billion for the year, but some speculated that the golden age of cloud computing growth was over. This is premature, and I expect growth to accelerate this year.\n\nDeclining data usage budgets were a massive obstacle in 2023. Businesses hunkered down for a recession that never came, and Amazon actively assisted its customers in lowering their data usage costs. Budgets are likely to loosen this year as fears of a recession ease. While this headwind fades, a new tailwind emerges. Much of AWS' sales are usage-based (much like a utility), so the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) software should spur growth because of the massive data needs.\n\nInvestors and analysts will watch AWS closely this year. A resurgence in growth could be a catalyst for the stock.\n\n2. Amazon's free cash flow is back\n\nEconomic stimulus during the pandemic's height pushed Amazon's free cash flow (the amount of money left after paying for expenses and fixed assets) to record highs, but multiple challenges saw it plunge in 2022. There were snarls at the ports, a shortage of workers, and record inflation, all of which caused increases in costs.\n\nAWS was also a victim of its own success. The massive growth meant massive investments in equipment (CapEx) were needed. Amazon spent a combined $125 billion on CapEx in 2021 and 2022, compared to $57 billion in 2020 and 2021. That is a ton of cash, even for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese challenges ironed themselves out in 2023, and free cash flow roared back, as you can see below.\n\nAMZN Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nAmazon will surely use the cash to invest in growth, but it could also institute a share buyback program if it chooses.\n\n3. Amazon's advertising segment impresses\n\nOne of Amazon's fastest-growing revenue streams is online revenue, which includes product placement, pay-per-click, and video. Advertisers are eager to purchase these spots because they know that the ads are reaching customers who are actively looking to buy. If you are like me, you rarely scroll past the first page, and sellers know it. Advertising sales have exploded, going from $13 billion in 2019 to $46 billion in 2023.\n\nThis marked the first time ad sales beat out Prime subscription sales ($47 billion versus $40 billion). The segment should also benefit from loosening budgets in 2024. This is another terrific, growing revenue stream for Amazon.\n\n4. Consumer sentiment is on the upswing\n\nYou can count me among those who thought rising interest rates and slowing economic stimulus would crimp consumer spending. But there are few signs that consumers are pulling back.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3395, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23775242-9d0d-416c-b90e-50c030b72be4": {"__data__": {"id_": "23775242-9d0d-416c-b90e-50c030b72be4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/444.html", "file_name": "444.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5250, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67753205-764c-4281-b779-6b0640b9ffc2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/444.html", "file_name": "444.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5250, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "9018a336447e9a35a0bca209c16be4b4618ac7f58468d1ce1047779f300d7366", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d695bb02-91b2-42c4-b603-1bd86be140c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/444.html", "file_name": "444.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5250, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "e71bfc21c00b1f2aeac638360e4d0423158ca04cb2be039157782b6d894e7ac3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "27093ca2-0688-44db-87a7-b8b90f1e74ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce1a58e831c42b09c35ee8be4d2e521b7003537a67913a753524075cf73885a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9012e72e577d521523dce1c48ab03eaf8ee576db69e3ac3bb1e155d3fdd3c9a6", "text": "If you are like me, you rarely scroll past the first page, and sellers know it.

Consumer sentiment is on the upswing\n\nYou can count me among those who thought rising interest rates and slowing economic stimulus would crimp consumer spending. But there are few signs that consumers are pulling back. In fact, consumer sentiment, widely considered the leading indicator of consumer spending, is rising steadily, as shown below.\n\nUS Index of Consumer Sentiment Chart\n\nThe number is still below pre-pandemic levels but has climbed impressively while inflation declines. This is excellent news because consumer spending is critical to Amazon's e-commerce business. Speaking of inflation, it has dropped to 3.2%. This shows that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes are taming inflation, and the economy is still growing. We aren't quite out of the woods yet, but so far, so good.\n\nAmazon stock has risen significantly over the last year, but it trades at a discount to its 5-year averages based on sales and operating cash flow. The tailwinds above make it an excellent long-term investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Its unbelievable market outperformance started at the beginning of 2023 and continues well into 2024, with the stock up more than 480%.\n\nBut just because it has risen that much doesn't necessarily mean investors have missed out; you can always buy the stock now.\n\nMany might be concerned about shares falling due to high expectations built into it. However, I can come up with three good reasons Nvidia is a buy right now, and investors of all opinions should consider these.\n\n1. GPU demand is still expanding\n\nNvidia's primary products are graphics processing units (GPUs), the hardware often tasked with complex computing, like engineering simulations or gaming graphics. But they're also useful for data gathering and training artificial intelligence (AI) models. That makes them a key factor in the AI revolution taking the world by storm.\n\nAs companies rush to build data centers to increase computing capability and power these ever-improving models, Nvidia's business has soared. In its latest quarter, Nvidia's revenue was up 265% to $22.1 billion. This brought its revenue for the full-year 2024 (ending Jan. 28) to $60.9 billion. And many market analysts believe there is more in store for GPU production.\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nPrecedence Research sees the GPU market expanding to $773 billion by 2032. Considering that Nvidia holds a firm grip on the GPU market, it will be the primary benefactor of this increase.\n\nJust because Nvidia has experienced unbelievable growth doesn't mean it's done yet. But investors shouldn't expect revenue to triple like it did over the past year.\n\n2. The AI market is massive and has barely been integrated into workflows\n\nAI is all the rage in the stock market, but how many people use it in their daily work? The reality is that very few people have been affected by its power. But with AI going mainstream through digital assistants, that is about to change.\n\nStory continues\n\nGPUs will be needed to harness the power of these tools, which is another boost for Nvidia. More innovations will follow once the workforce becomes comfortable with using AI to improve productivity.\n\nThese innovations will require more computing power because previous models are being run on existing infrastructure, so GPUs will once again benefit from AI proliferation.\n\nThe last piece of the puzzle is Nvidia's H100 GPU. This is its flagship model, but the company is working on its replacement already. The H200 GPU is expected to launch in Q2 2024, and will essentially double the computing capacity for a single GPU compared to the H100. The increase in computing power and efficiency will drive many to upgrade, which will be another boost for the chipmaker. Additionally, it keeps Nvidia ahead of the competition, further cementing its place on top of the GPU world.\n\nWe're in the early innings of AI affecting work, and Nvidia is set to capitalize.\n\n3. The stock isn't as expensive as you'd think\n\nThe previous two reasons don't involve the stock; they only concern the future. However, thanks to Nvidia's growth, the stock isn't as expensive as it used to be.\n\nWhen a company is undergoing a massive transformation, it's useful to look at the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which uses analyst projections. This analysis isn't perfect, but it gives investors a better idea of where Nvidia is heading rather than looking at where it has been.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhile Nvidia's P/E ratio has been sky-high at times, its forward earnings have hovered around reasonable levels -- 38 times forward earnings is still a very expensive price tag for a stock, but it looks much more palatable than 78 times trailing earnings.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3735, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9e342f8-3424-4d11-b0df-787d584ed643": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9e342f8-3424-4d11-b0df-787d584ed643", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/445.html", "file_name": "445.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5056, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "60d12d9f-1c37-4ee7-abb8-af5f3dd2561a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/445.html", "file_name": "445.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5056, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f5720ee42817c6c42a30192f1bd8c863094d76748560b0221975197fca6b3e14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "27093ca2-0688-44db-87a7-b8b90f1e74ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/445.html", "file_name": "445.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5056, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "ce1a58e831c42b09c35ee8be4d2e521b7003537a67913a753524075cf73885a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d5a08e0-8c94-419a-bb38-dddb3055c139", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00cd6f2bfb7ab24dd7f33376fc6783b49c432c86e69d3793b44e9fef6a49512e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ce1f66869cbf49f658497c4514e8ebd20c50807c59e1e4418afb742f31c711b3", "text": "However, thanks to Nvidia's growth, the stock isn't as expensive as it used to be.\n\nWhen a company is undergoing a massive transformation, it's useful to look at the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which uses analyst projections.

Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) are among the biggest players in this space. NDVA, in particular, has been on a tear recently, as the graphics processing units it specializes in are especially useful in AI applications. INTC is more of a stalwart in the industry but has remained relevant since its founding in 1968. Which of the two is the better investment? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nFind Out: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\n\nRead More: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n\nQuality\n\nWhile both companies are huge and likely to be financially stable, that doesn\u2019t mean they are on equal footing. The Altman Z-Score is a financial measure used to determine the bankruptcy risk of a business \u2013 both NVDA and INTC have a Z-score high enough to garner a \u201csafe\u201d rating. Both companies also have about $7 billion in cash on their balance sheets. However, given that NVDA\u2019s market cap is significantly higher, this indicates that INTC probably has a safer balance sheet.\n\nEdge: INTC\n\nGrowth\n\nA company\u2019s future growth prospects are another important factor to consider before investing. You might expect NVDA to be the clear winner here, as its recent performance has been so impressive, and INTC is no longer considered a growth company \u2014 but that kind of outperformance is hard to maintain. Analysts expect NVDA to grow at about 36% per year over the next five years, which is certainly above average. However, analysts expect INTC to grow by 43% per year over the same period. Surprisingly, it looks like INTC has the best growth prospects in the near to mid-term.\n\nEdge: INTC\n\nValuation\n\nProbably the most important consideration when analyzing an investment is valuation \u2013 at the end of the day, the price you pay determines your return. Even an amazing business can be a bad investment at the wrong price. The most commonly used metric for publicly traded stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The lower the ratio, the cheaper the stock, and all other things are equal. You might guess that high-flying NVDA is more richly priced than INTC, but this is another surprise. INTC is trading at a trailing twelve-month P/E ratio of 111.3 as of 3/6/24, while NVDA is trading at 74.6 over the same period. It\u2019s worth noting that INTC is in the middle of a turnaround effort, so the market is pricing in the prospect of better earnings in the near future \u2013 nevertheless, NVDA appears to be the cheaper stock on paper.\n\nEdge: NVDA\n\nThe Winner: INTC\n\nArguably, NVDA has the brightest future of the two stocks \u2013 but again, it\u2019s important to remember that just being a good business doesn\u2019t make a stock a good investment. When a company has gone through a major growth run, it can often counterintuitively become a risky investment. In this case, INTC looks like the safer choice. However, things can change fast in the stock market, so be sure to re-evaluate your investments regularly.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Nvidia vs. Intel Stock: Which Is a Better Investment?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3212, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "354d165b-57a8-435b-bccd-3c7aa7f47e91": {"__data__": {"id_": "354d165b-57a8-435b-bccd-3c7aa7f47e91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/45.html", "file_name": "45.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2688, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4a462b7c-d849-497f-b428-30c32f2c59bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/45.html", "file_name": "45.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2688, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "1219fb84667ca7d019d51a0966152413c8dc2109144ac0f4abd197cf8d15108f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ce488b1-30fa-40d3-a208-ebcf6ab1a6c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/447.html", "file_name": "447.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3244, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "35de398abb5ea15db090a529c0c2d71cb9fc460dab6ffa32b39f406c493af848", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bdba0bfc-e514-49e0-a465-c8a2defba0be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9c6816e2f7a8348b7eb0b8ffbf2b4414cdab376905e4fac4e29e939acc0a8525", "text": "Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) just announced the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful chip\u201d for AI.

Parallels that make some investors nervous today.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).\n\nBut as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today\u2019s market isn\u2019t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.\n\nHow can I say such a thing?\n\nIt\u2019s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nBack then, besotted people (I wouldn\u2019t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.\n\nWhy were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn\u2019t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.\n\nSo people who had bought into the dot-com hype \u2014 and there were plenty of them \u2014 mostly bought individual stocks.\n\nThese days, people talk \u2014 mistakenly, in my opinion \u2014 about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst.\n\nPets.com, the leading online pet retailer, announced Nov. 7, 2000, that it was closing down and laying off more than 250 of its 320 employees after being unable to find a purchaser or a financial backer for the company. (Newsmakers) (Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That\u2019s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.\n\n(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)\n\nTwo months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced \u2014 on Mar. 10, 2000 \u2014 the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.\n\nThen the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.\n\nUltimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn\u2019t score another new high until April 23, 2015 \u2014 more than 15 years after the previous peak.\n\nEven one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble \u2014 Cisco Systems \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.\n\nBarring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now?

Doesn\u2019t this mean that we\u2019re in a bubble?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. Among the reasons is that even though the Seven were incredibly hot, the other S&P companies \u2014 let\u2019s call them the Non-Magnificent 493 \u2014 had a total return of 9.9%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That\u2019s about the average return the US market has shown over the long term.\n\nThe Pets.com sock puppet dog stars in a commercial for the company in Los Angeles, Jan. 11, 2000. (Bob Riha/Liaison/Getty Images) (Bob Riha Jr. via Getty Images)\n\nAmazingly, this year\u2019s market, despite a recent decline, is on track to outperform last year\u2019s market. The S&P had returned 7.28% through Friday\u2019s close, according to Silverblatt. Extrapolate that 2.5-month return to a full year and you get 34.9%.\n\nAnd now, some of last year\u2019s Magnificent Seven are having a less-than-magnificent 2024. Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday\u2019s close \u2014 the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P\u2019s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)\n\nThe point here is that it doesn\u2019t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren\u2019t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.\n\nLook. I\u2019m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days \u2014 it\u2019s not cheap by any standard. And I\u2019m not telling you that it\u2019s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.\n\nBut what I am telling you is that there\u2019s a big difference between a high-priced market like today\u2019s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nThere may be some difficult times ahead for investors. But a decline of almost 80% over the next two and a half years?

This shift was largely influenced by NVIDIA (NVDA, Financial), which saw its stock rebound after an initial decline of 3.9%. This was in response to the unveiling of the Blackwell AI platform at its GTC Conference. NVIDIA's recovery played a key role in steering the broader market towards gains, culminating in the S&P 500 reaching a new record closing high.\n\nSector Performance\n\nThe energy sector led the gains with a 1.1% increase, buoyed by a rise in WTI crude futures to $82.69.\n\nUtilities, sensitive to interest rates, followed closely with a 0.9% gain.\n\nReal estate remained unchanged, while communication services slightly declined by 0.2%.\n\nOverall, nine out of the eleven S&P 500 sectors ended the day higher.\n\nInterest Rates and Bonds\n\nThe 2-year note yield fell by four basis points to 4.69%, and the 10-year note yield also dropped by four basis points to 4.30%.\n\nThese movements occurred despite positive housing starts and building permits reports for February and significant policy changes by the Bank of Japan (BOJ).\n\nThe BOJ's exit from its negative interest rate policy and adjustments to its yield curve control and asset purchase strategies were notable events.\n\nA $20-year bond reopening was well-received, contributing to the positive performance in the Treasury market.\n\nForeign Exchange and Commodities\n\nThe yen weakened against the dollar, with the USD/JPY pair rising by 1.2% to 150.91, following the BOJ's policy adjustments.\n\nThis contributed to a 0.4% increase in the U.S. Dollar Index to 103.82.\n\nIn commodities, crude oil and natural gas saw increases, while gold, silver, and copper experienced declines.\n\nEconomic Data and Expectations\n\nRecent economic data highlighted a 10.7% month-over-month increase in housing starts and a 1.9% rise in building permits for February. These figures suggest a rebound from January's weather-affected slowdown, supporting a stable economic outlook. Looking ahead, the focus shifts to the upcoming FOMC decision, with market participants keenly awaiting the Fed's rate projections and Fed Chair Powell's commentary.\n\nToday's News\n\nU.S. stocks closed higher on Tuesday, with the technology sector leading the gains after a mid-day turnaround. Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) saw its stock recover from early losses to close in the green, buoyed by CEO Jensen Huang's comments on the company's prospects in the data center market. Huang's optimistic outlook on gaining a larger share of the data center market, coupled with the unveiling of new chips at Nvidia's annual GTC conference, helped reverse the stock's initial dip.\n\nAltria Group (MO, Financial) announced accelerated share repurchase transactions worth $2.4 billion with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, aiming to repurchase a significant portion of its stock. This move is part of Altria's expanded $3.4 billion share repurchase program, expected to be completed by the end of 2024.\n\nWilliams Companies (WMB, Financial) disclosed that it considered acquiring Tellurian (TELL, Financial) but ultimately deemed the investment too risky. Despite the potential speed to market of Tellurian's Driftwood LNG project, concerns over commercial contracts led Williams to pass on the opportunity.\n\nReddit (RDDT, Financial) is set to go public, with its IPO reportedly oversubscribed by four to five times.

day on Monday but managed to close mostly higher. With the upward move, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 regained ground after closing lower for three straight sessions.\n\nWhile the major averages came under pressure going into the close, they managed to end the day in positive territory. The Nasdaq advanced 130.27 points or 0.8 percent at 16,103.45, the S&P 500 climbed 32.33 points or 0.6 percent to 5,149.42 and the Dow rose 75.66 points or 0.2 percent at 38,790.43.\n\nTechnology stocks helped lead the early rally on Wall Street, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq showing a particularly strong move to the upside.\n\nShares of Alphabet (GOOGL) surged by 4.6 percent after a report from Bloomberg said Apple (AAPL) is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) also jumped early in the session ahead of its GTC Conference, where the chipmaker is expected to provide updates on its AI initiatives, but gave back ground before ending the day up by 0.7 percent.\n\nAt the same time, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) plunged by 6.4 percent after the information company was added to the S&P 500 before the start of trading.\n\nMeanwhile, traders continued to look ahead to the Federal Reserve's two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, but the central bank's accompanying statement and economic projections could have a significant impact on the outlook for rates.\n\nRecent hotter-than-expected inflation readings have reduced optimism about the likelihood of the Fed's first rate cut coming in June.\n\nIn U.S. economic news, a report released by the National Association of Home Builders showed an unexpected improvement in U.S. homebuilder confidence in the month of March.\n\nThe report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose to 51 in March from 48 in February. Economists had expected the index to come in unchanged.\n\nWith the unexpected increase, the housing market index surpassed the breakeven point of 50 for the first time since hitting 56 last July.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged by 2.7 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index jumped by 1.0 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets moved modestly lower on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index dipped by 0.2 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index edged down by 0.1 percent and the German DAX Index closed just below the unchanged line.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries extended the downward trend seen throughout the previous week. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, climbed 3.6 basis points to a three-month closing high of 4.340 percent.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nTrading activity on Tuesday may be somewhat subdued as traders look ahead to the Fed announcement, although a report on new residential construction may attract some attention.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact:

All told, the universe of AI-themed ETFs traded in the United States has soared to $6.88 billion as of the end of February from $2.55 billion a year earlier, Morningstar data showed.\n\n\"It's still so early in the evolution of this category ... that investors are still sorting through the possibilities,\" said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares.\n\nThe exuberance surrounding AI funds echoes previous waves of investor excitement for other technologies viewed as transformative, from dotcom stocks to electric vehicles.\n\nEach wave introduced major new businesses to the economy and generated astonishing wealth for founders like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as well as ordinary investors. At the same time, many of the companies whose shares soared in previous market booms eventually saw their stock prices fizzle, a fate that may await some of the market\u2019s current AI favorites.\n\nFor now, investors are responding with enthusiasm and Nvidia - whose chips are seen as the gold standard in AI - continues to grab the spotlight.\n\nThe assets of the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which seeks to deliver twice the daily return of the chipmaker\u2019s shares and is not included in Morningstar\u2019s data on AI-themed funds, doubled to $2 billion earlier this month. Those flows have followed the nearly 80% climb in Nvidia's shares so far this year, after the company's shares tripled in 2023.\n\nAt its developer conference on Monday, the company unveiled the Blackwell B200, an AI chip it says is up to 30 times speedier than its previous chip.\n\nSmaller ETFs have also prospered. Assets in the Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF tripled to about $20 million from $7.5 million earlier this month, said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeven of the 18 diversified AI-related ETFs that Morningstar tracks have launched within the last three years. An eighth was redesigned to target AI more directly.\n\nThe funds have had collective inflows of $2.68 billion in the last 12 months, according to Morningstar. That is almost double the inflows into global real estate ETFs, the company said.\n\nWhether investor excitement about the possibilities of AI is fueling a bubble or just contributing to a strong bull run in stocks is unclear.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 8% year-to-date, fueled in part by rallies in AI beneficiaries such as Nvidia and Microsoft, following a 24% gain last year. The AI fervor has also driven parabolic moves in the shares of other companies, including a more than 250% gain in Super Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 this week.\n\nSome investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves. ETF issuer Global X found that its Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF, which caps Nvidia exposure to 3%, has tripled in size over the last three months.\n\nBy comparison, its Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has more than 20% of its assets invested in the chipmaker, grew by 20%.\n\nOthers are focused on finding new areas that will benefit from AI, said Rene Reyna, head of thematic ETF strategy at Invesco and manager of the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3596, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62f22eac-6999-463b-b42c-9e5f172ba0ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "62f22eac-6999-463b-b42c-9e5f172ba0ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/462.html", "file_name": "462.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5017, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3fd8785f-a8f6-4b16-9af9-5f061198bba1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/462.html", "file_name": "462.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5017, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "e043630bae9e6bba8b293e816cb264af60eb2992d1d1ab7af4b75e067cf14f26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "92743e34-e7b2-4034-b35e-90a2cfc21935", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/462.html", "file_name": "462.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5017, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "4bd87cc53a7d89e811f902f8f3a612ee40b3b861115bd2c378bf71650ae5848b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8141a7d1-204b-4506-aaa1-cd156676262d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1605266a17348c5380b52206f27c35f0b7b466392b75a8b004f00e02fe986af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5703a7fa41d104d1b38ecdfad791bc349e6ca2262e744e2b0fb2b19966d05ce2", "text": "Some investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves.

Less obvious beneficiaries included Walmart and Caterpillar. The bank also recommended exploring \"less crowded sub-themes\" like the integration of AI and smartphones.\n\nETFs are also scrambling to provide offerings for every taste. Robo Global Robotics & Automation ETF supplements its Nvidia exposure with holdings in stocks some expect to benefit from AI technology, like Intuitive Surgical. The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF is focusing on companies it expects to be beneficiaries of generative AI, including Salesforce.com and Marvell Technology.\n\nStill, at least one flavor of AI-themed ETF has failed to win fans.

SoundHound's namesake app is used to identify and discover songs, while its Houndify developer platform enables companies to create their own speech-recognition tools. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is a leading producer of AI servers.\n\nBoth companies have close ties to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia was one of SoundHound's earliest backers prior to its public debut in 2022, and it recently made another investment in the company. Supermicro's partnership with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center graphics processing units (GPUs) before most of its competitors.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThat's why both stocks soared alongside Nvidia's as the AI market expanded. Over the past 12 months, SoundHound's stock jumped 248% as Supermicro's stock rallied 1,150%. But should you invest in either of these high-flying AI stocks right now?\n\nSoundHound is a speculative stock\n\nSoundHound competes against Microsoft and Alphabet's Google in the audio and speech-recognition market, but its Houndify platform is an appealing option for companies that don't want to tether themselves to those tech giants.\n\nAutomakers like Hyundai and Stellantis, smart TV makers like Vizio, and fast-food chains like Church's Chicken all use Houndify to create custom voice-recognition services. That market should continue expanding as generative AI technologies become more sophisticated. It also recently acquired the restaurant-solutions provider SYNQ3 to expand its ecosystem.\n\nSoundHound went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022. Its revenue rose 47% in both 2022 and 2023, and analysts expect its revenue to rise 51% to $69.5 million in 2024.\n\nBut based on those expectations and its enterprise value of $2.2 billion, SoundHound's stock still looks pricey at 32 times this year's sales. It's also unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, and it doesn't even expect its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to turn positive until 2025. Its high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.3 could also limit its ability to raise fresh cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose issues could limit its upside potential as long as interest rates stay elevated, but it could still carve out a defensible niche in the evolving voice-recognition market and attract some buyout interest from its bigger competitors.\n\nSupermicro is a foundational player in the AI market\n\nSupermicro isn't the world's largest producer of pre-built servers, but it differentiated itself from its larger competitors by building high-performance servers for tougher tasks. That focus made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which worked with Supermicro to design AI servers which used its high-end data center GPUs. Nvidia's rival AMD has also been working with Supermicro to develop new AI servers for that booming market.\n\nWhen Supermicro went public back in 2007, it didn't initially gain much attention because the server market was already heavily commoditized. But over the past few years, it became one of the market's hottest growth stocks as the generative AI market exploded and data center operators ramped up their orders of AI servers.\n\nSupermicro's revenue soared 46% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) and grew another 37% in fiscal 2023.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3519, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de4b0d69-4380-4f80-bcb8-c8ca0cb50062": {"__data__": {"id_": "de4b0d69-4380-4f80-bcb8-c8ca0cb50062", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/473.html", "file_name": "473.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5911, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35472ca8-b30e-43f1-a6ba-9a0a3b89d875", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/473.html", "file_name": "473.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5911, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "98feee9dd4f5b344a21406f88795f40027cb3ec0c965bc382e4bf81a1400143b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2b9cdfc-e6ad-4d6a-ac87-421b85bbbc7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/473.html", "file_name": "473.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5911, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5fe286132282d92249b7ef0dd4b671c722d1d31600ee5394ac3d3bc3544b45bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d20625b-6c0c-469e-8efe-695ead321027", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "10bcb79c1f1c6f6e70b6fb19a76531cf5cc214f976de2ff50a07dd761b6fa61c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "83ce4a7bf991e61f479f3bba2d6e182d484ed38991762f1772a5a56d0f37cd88", "text": "That focus made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which worked with Supermicro to design AI servers which used its high-end data center GPUs.

It's profitable, and analysts expect its earnings per share (EPS) to soar 86% in 2024 and 35% in 2025. Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those expectations at 37 times forward earnings and 3 times next year's sales. But the AI market needs to keep expanding -- and Supermicro needs to consistently grow its share of the AI server market -- for the company to reach those targets and support its rising valuations.\n\nThe better buy: Super Micro Computer\n\nBoth of these AI companies are growing rapidly, but Supermicro is clearly a better buy than SoundHound AI. Supermicro has a more established business; it has a wider moat; it's more profitable; and its stock looks cheaper.

(UBER).\n\nDelta will be among the first companies to report second-quarter earnings next month. Its shares are up 27.8% over the past twelve months, better than its major legacy rivals American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (UAL). And while air travel is miserable for many people and airline stocks often make for a bumpy ride, analysts generally like Delta's efforts to bring in revenue from more places outside of the main cabin.\n\n\"While Delta is keeping a close eye on the health of the consumer, overall demand remains strong particularly post the Jan/Feb off-peak period,\" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, who has a \"strong buy\" rating on Delta shares, said in a research note this month.\n\n\"Corporate travel is slightly improved as expected, notably driven by a step-up in the tech sector,\" she continued.\n\nWhile Delta tempered its full-year financial outlook in January - amid a \"testy\" geopolitical backdrop, volatile energy prices and limits on aircraft availability - TD Cowen analyst Helane Becker also said at the time that the resulting sell-off made for a buying opportunity.\n\nShe noted increases in corporate-travel sales, after a pandemic-era cratering, and sales gains for flights across the Atlantic and Pacific. Moreover, sales for the airline's premium seat classes, which are better for profits, and its loyalty program continued to outpace the sales it gets from the main cabin, Becker noted.\n\nAnalysts, overall, are reluctant to hit sell on stocks. Of the 11,557 ratings on stocks in the S&P 500 Index, 53.8% are buy ratings, according to the FactSet report. 40.5% are hold ratings, while only 5.7% are sell ratings.\n\nThis week in earnings\n\nFor the week ahead, food prices will be in focus when General Mills Inc.

For the past several quarters, that demand hasn't been great. In response, the company, which reports results on Thursday, has tried to cut billions in costs.\n\nAs executives detailed in December, FedEx's (FDX) big air-and-ground Express business is struggling, amid what executives have said is a slowdown in global production and Asia specifically, and consumers are seeking out cheaper shipping services. Among other things, Becker, the TD Cowen analyst, said in a research note on FedEx (FDX) on Friday that she would be focused on where that cost-cutting campaign stands now, and trends in package volumes e-commerce demand.\n\n\"FDX has been growing this business, and we expect them to discuss how things are changing as people return to office and retailers offer deals to shoppers to go to brick and mortar stores,\" she said. \"Also, we have seen several retailers recently file for bankruptcy and wonder at the impact on their business, if at all.\"\n\nThe number to watch\n\nNike sales, margins: Like FedEx, Nike is also cutting costs, as consumers remain reluctant to take the plunge on a new pair of sneakers. The athletic-gear giant's quarterly results, set for Thursday, will likely offer more detail on what has already been cut and might still be cut up ahead, as it tries to do more to draw women customers, expand its Jordan brand offerings and simplify assortments elsewhere.\n\nAhead of the results, UBS analyst Jay Sole said he was \"not expecting a big catalyst\" from Nike's results. And as Nike tries to work through what it called \"complexity and inefficiencies\" that arose following efforts to sell more gear directly, through its own stores and e-commerce platform, he said the company could resort to selling through Foot Locker a bit more in the months ahead to hit Wall Street's profit and sales targets.\n\n\"We also expect sentiment to stay near current levels,\" Sole said. \"The market is looking for an inflection in Nike's sales growth trend, but probably won't get one.\"\n\n-Bill Peters\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Loading...\n\nWharton School finance professor, Jeremy James Siegel, has suggested that Nvidia NVDA shares could double or even triple, mirroring the trajectory of Cisco CSCO during the dot-com bubble, as Nvidia continues to drive the U.S. equity market to new heights.\n\nWhat Happened: Nvidia\u2019s stock has been a significant force behind the latest stock market rally fueled by the AI boom. The company\u2019s high-end chips, essential for AI services like ChatGPT, have seen unprecedented demand, leading to explosive sales growth, reported Investing.com.\n\nThe company\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market, holding an estimated 80% share. With superior efficiency in AI-specific tasks, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs outperform more versatile central processing units (CPUs) produced by firms like Intel INTC. Nvidia\u2019s stock skyrocketed over 270% over the past year, and this year alone, it\u2019s up 82%, broadly outperforming the market.\n\nNvidia\u2019s rise has drawn parallels to the dot com bubble of the late \u201990s to early 2000s, a period of excessive speculation in internet companies leading to rocketing stock prices. During this time, Cisco became one of the most valuable companies in the world by market capitalization, showcasing the period\u2019s investment fervor in tech and internet-related stocks.\n\nDespite a recent 10% intraday drop, Siegel believes Nvidia\u2019s momentum is unphased and predicts further highs. His commentary suggests that if Nvidia follows Cisco\u2019s valuation path, its stock could reach as much as $2700, resulting in a market cap of $6.8 trillion.\n\n\"There could be 2-3x more upside in Nvidia if it follows Cisco's valuation path to its peak. To be clear\u2014this is not my prediction of what will happen\u2014just to note as to what is possible in a mega bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nSee Also: Why Can\u2019t Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Keep Up With Other Meme Coins?\n\nWhy It Matters: Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a remarkable run, with an 80% year-to-date surge, driven by the soaring demand for its AI-enabling graphic cards. Earlier today, Bank of America (BofA) reaffirmed its optimistic outlook on Nvidia despite its surging valuation, establishing a price target of $1,100 for the stock. In a note released on Wednesday, the bank upheld its \u201cBuy\u201d rating for Nvidia, emphasizing that even with a $2.2 trillion valuation, the stock remains reasonably priced.\n\nHowever, Nvidia\u2019s rapid rise has also raised questions about the potential of its competitors. Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD has closely followed Nvidia\u2019s rapid rise, driven by the excitement surrounding AI.\n\nRead Next: Meme Coins \u2013 Jackpots and Gambles In the Wild World Of Crypto\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

This could include robotaxis and autonomous delivery vehicles, it added. Li Auto LI and Zeekr have already announced that they will be using the centralized car computer.\n\nDRIVE Thor, announced in 2022, is slated for production vehicles starting next year and can deliver feature-rich cockpit capabilities in addition to automated driving.\n\nThe company said on Monday that BYD, in addition to building the next-generation EV fleet on the platform, will also be using the company\u2019s AI infrastructure for cloud-based AI development and training technologies.\n\nHyper\u2019s next-generation EVs will be built on the platform starting next year and will have level 4 driving capabilities. XPeng will employ the platform as the AI Brain of its next generation of EV fleet, it added.\n\nWhy It Matters: Nvidia also delivers computing to U.S. EV giant Tesla Inc. which is also looking to achieve autonomous driving. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously pinned the delay in achieving autonomous driving on a shortage of computing power.\n\nHowever, last week, the CEO said that the shortage is largely resolved, possibly with the help of both Nvidia\u2019s compute and Tesla\u2019s own Dojo supercomputer.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders Voice Support For Volkswagen Workers Looking To Join UAW: \u2018American Workers, Too, Should Have A Voice'\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1877, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79a9806d-d8dc-4876-9b7c-f1a13256425f": {"__data__": {"id_": "79a9806d-d8dc-4876-9b7c-f1a13256425f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/490.html", "file_name": "490.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "695f42f4-4b53-4032-947f-ff8699d92724", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/490.html", "file_name": "490.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5cf16a1e3b9373780bd88d4ee8c6a28e8d900823be09ae4680ba7983bb22a046", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d18b5c50-f677-4944-970e-dccfc96cb8e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/49.html", "file_name": "49.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 1891, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a4ae8ce667357885feaf12a7eb598ae38e4bd28c4ba5186c2622a86229f4dda8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5624cd8a-4eab-4076-a99f-8670ea2dd428", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fc1ee7c42d2323e3aed7b770e4f3db0974c90c006358700eca900737ee13166", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "text": "", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5624cd8a-4eab-4076-a99f-8670ea2dd428": {"__data__": {"id_": "5624cd8a-4eab-4076-a99f-8670ea2dd428", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/492.html", "file_name": "492.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3021, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5090a72d-c145-4b75-b302-4074a0585455", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/492.html", "file_name": "492.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3021, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "cdae75164eefc0c7725aa5a6a9fb544592d7b7f403717a40274bb643d4295075", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "79a9806d-d8dc-4876-9b7c-f1a13256425f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/490.html", "file_name": "490.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a93ec496-cead-416d-8be9-6b115deb6c04", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3fe7127cab162e9db26b7c498b6ea471eca40ccdd1f245dc8967a34c6ee69c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2fc1ee7c42d2323e3aed7b770e4f3db0974c90c006358700eca900737ee13166", "text": "Stocks have shown a strong move to the upside during trading on Monday, regaining ground after trending lower over the past few sessions.

Economists had expected the index to come in unchanged.\n\nWith the unexpected increase, the housing market index surpassed the breakeven point of 50 for the first time since hitting 56 last July.\n\nSector News\n\nDespite the significant rally by the broader , most of the major sectors are showing only modest moves on the day.\n\nSemiconductor stocks are seeing considerable strength, however, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbing by 1.2 percent.\n\nSoftware and retail stocks are also seeing some strength on the day, while gold stocks have moved to the downside.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged by 2.7 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index jumped by 1.0 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets have moved modestly lower on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is just below the unchanged line.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries are extending the downward trend seen throughout the previous week. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 2.4 basis points at 4.328 percent.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3021, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a93ec496-cead-416d-8be9-6b115deb6c04": {"__data__": {"id_": "a93ec496-cead-416d-8be9-6b115deb6c04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/493.html", "file_name": "493.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2674, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3fa0564b-2e55-4c17-91f9-99080988b3e1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/493.html", "file_name": "493.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2674, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d17614a49810054db19421477c0ba8f0ad0db4b6e10883b38e85088e71291fb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5624cd8a-4eab-4076-a99f-8670ea2dd428", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/492.html", "file_name": "492.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3021, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "2fc1ee7c42d2323e3aed7b770e4f3db0974c90c006358700eca900737ee13166", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d732cf32-fe4a-46c7-b277-f8ab3a61de3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b3fe7127cab162e9db26b7c498b6ea471eca40ccdd1f245dc8967a34c6ee69c4", "text": "Loading...

But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?\n\nWhile I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.\n\nIn this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status.\n\nThe Top Dogs\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.\n\nWe can see that Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nNvidia: The Undisputed King of AI\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.\n\nThis dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.\n\nNvidia's stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren't looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon: Multifaceted Technology Enterprise\n\nAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.\n\nMeta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.\n\nUnder CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.\n\nMeta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3745, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c37954cd-0560-45f5-85fc-6181092096bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "c37954cd-0560-45f5-85fc-6181092096bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/508.html", "file_name": "508.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7457, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10a81ed5-4f91-46b2-b208-b80e3faba7ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/508.html", "file_name": "508.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7457, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "9f111f41e408d26b6378eba976d7fa3244b90e1434ff01a62a8a9a1ad3d89611", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "72310c98-d084-4eab-8b6c-61fe8dc94f7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/508.html", "file_name": "508.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7457, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "de663ed4f3d4f326524357b0fbc1dbc58c2e7498710f9beb877533011ce11f2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e5d7d42-cc46-4368-85c7-5e8fceba2076", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e244e52effaec0ba93ad1e034d51add1b70b5238ffe4eb6c918e6ac9920537e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "62ca84d2931c029fc109b74ebbe37eb5be8944aae050178e54f5a62d09fe19c3", "text": "Meta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500.

Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n\nMeta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nMicrosoft: On the Cusp\n\nMicrosoft is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.\n\nOne major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.\n\nSomething worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities.

Isaac Manipulator is a series of foundation models designed for robotic arms, while Issac Perceptor is meant to offer \u201cmulti-camera, 3D surround-vision capabilities\u201d for robots designed to take on manufacturing and fulfillment roles.\n\nIn addition to those, the graphics giant also debuted its Jetson Thor computer for humanoid robots. The platform, which is powered by Nvidia\u2019s Thor system-on-a-chip, will serve as the brains of humanoid robots.\n\nAI engineer Jenna Reher works on humanoid robot Figure 01 at Figure AI's test facility in Sunnyvale, Calif., Oct. 3, 2023. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\u201cJetson Thor was created as a new computing platform capable of performing complex tasks and interacting safely and naturally with people and machines. It has a modular architecture optimized for performance, power, and size,\u201d Nvidia said in a statement.\n\nThe company says it\u2019s already working with some of the biggest names in robotics including Boston Dynamics, famous for its Spot robot, 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, and Figure AI.\n\nFigure AI, in particular, has been making waves of late, releasing a video last week in which it showed a humanoid robot speak as though it was a person in response to prompts and complete a series of tasks, including picking up dishes and putting them in a drying rack.\n\nWhile that may seem relatively mundane, the technology needed to get the robot to recognize each item and move them precisely is incredibly sophisticated.\n\nSubscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIn February, Nvidia, as well as Microsoft, OpenAI, Jeff Bezos, Parkway Capital, Intel Capital, and others, took part in a Series B funding round for Figure AI valuing the company at $2.6 billion.\n\nHumanoid robots offer the promise of being able to complete dangerous or rote tasks for people, though as with other AI technologies, they also raise the specter of displacing human jobs. Still, don\u2019t expect humanoid robots to start strolling down the street anytime soon.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

All told, the universe of AI-themed ETFs traded in the United States has soared to $6.88 billion as of the end of February from $2.55 billion a year earlier, Morningstar data showed.\n\n\"It's still so early in the evolution of this category ... that investors are still sorting through the possibilities,\" said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares.\n\nThe exuberance surrounding AI funds echoes previous waves of investor excitement for other technologies viewed as transformative, from dotcom stocks to electric vehicles.\n\nEach wave introduced major new businesses to the economy and generated astonishing wealth for founders like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as well as ordinary investors. At the same time, many of the companies whose shares soared in previous market booms eventually saw their stock prices fizzle, a fate that may await some of the market\u2019s current AI favorites.\n\nFor now, investors are responding with enthusiasm and Nvidia - whose chips are seen as the gold standard in AI - continues to grab the spotlight.\n\nThe assets of the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which seeks to deliver twice the daily return of the chipmaker\u2019s shares and is not included in Morningstar\u2019s data on AI-themed funds, doubled to $2 billion earlier this month. Those flows have followed the nearly 80% climb in Nvidia's shares so far this year, after the company's shares tripled in 2023.\n\nAt its developer conference on Monday, the company unveiled the Blackwell B200, an AI chip it says is up to 30 times speedier than its previous chip.\n\nSmaller ETFs have also prospered. Assets in the Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF tripled to about $20 million from $7.5 million earlier this month, said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs.\n\nSeven of the 18 diversified AI-related ETFs that Morningstar tracks have launched within the last three years. An eighth was redesigned to target AI more directly.\n\nThe funds have had collective inflows of $2.68 billion in the last 12 months, according to Morningstar. That is almost double the inflows into global real estate ETFs, the company said.\n\nWhether investor excitement about the possibilities of AI is fueling a bubble or just contributing to a strong bull run in stocks is unclear.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 8% year-to-date, fueled in part by rallies in AI beneficiaries such as Nvidia and Microsoft, following a 24% gain last year. The AI fervor has also driven parabolic moves in the shares of other companies, including a more than 250% gain in Super Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 this week.\n\nSome investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves. ETF issuer Global X found that its Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF, which caps Nvidia exposure to 3%, has tripled in size over the last three months.\n\nBy comparison, its Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has more than 20% of its assets invested in the chipmaker, grew by 20%.\n\nOthers are focused on finding new areas that will benefit from AI, said Rene Reyna, head of thematic ETF strategy at Invesco and manager of the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f65acd0-2964-4483-a093-771ec3293d86": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f65acd0-2964-4483-a093-771ec3293d86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/518.html", "file_name": "518.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5000, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc1a331d-3a1e-45d2-a7ae-08da2a139413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/518.html", "file_name": "518.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5000, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "c7f893fa7a808d9202bf2493fb23956130dbcdf56e9aacca154599446f029bc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "67761629-61e2-471b-a20d-8435df3713ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/518.html", "file_name": "518.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5000, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "ab980209246ba9fb5203165be0b18895edd21982ba2b6780deb80ae07e8a3b39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "155e90bb-d92e-4a79-b601-ac5fbce205cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5703a7fa41d104d1b38ecdfad791bc349e6ca2262e744e2b0fb2b19966d05ce2", "text": "Some investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves.

Less obvious beneficiaries included Walmart and Caterpillar. The bank also recommended exploring \"less crowded sub-themes\" like the integration of AI and smartphones.\n\nETFs are also scrambling to provide offerings for every taste. Robo Global Robotics & Automation ETF supplements its Nvidia exposure with holdings in stocks some expect to benefit from AI technology, like Intuitive Surgical. The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF is focusing on companies it expects to be beneficiaries of generative AI, including Salesforce.com and Marvell Technology.\n\nStill, at least one flavor of AI-themed ETF has failed to win fans. The WisdomTree US AI Enhanced Value ETF, which uses AI to select its portfolio, has seen outflows of $48.26 million in the last 12 months and lags the S&P 500.\n\nOne possible reason the fund and others in its category have underperformed: many of them lack a position in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)", "start_char_idx": 2978, "end_char_idx": 4988, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "155e90bb-d92e-4a79-b601-ac5fbce205cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "155e90bb-d92e-4a79-b601-ac5fbce205cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/519.html", "file_name": "519.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "16ce574b-d049-4426-a7f6-b3ed572d34c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/519.html", "file_name": "519.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "e738876f54c90baa247a93ce37b40ef5ac93876d439b757356e6be209d964753", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f65acd0-2964-4483-a093-771ec3293d86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/518.html", "file_name": "518.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5000, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5703a7fa41d104d1b38ecdfad791bc349e6ca2262e744e2b0fb2b19966d05ce2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed0d2bf9-e9a6-41c2-a586-aa70aab7a0b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "913bf21fe65c8906a23a431737cb52700ef6fd10b16857544e78e6e158b04f14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "text": "", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed0d2bf9-e9a6-41c2-a586-aa70aab7a0b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed0d2bf9-e9a6-41c2-a586-aa70aab7a0b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/52.html", "file_name": "52.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2208, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "baecc4c0-58d9-403e-bc77-efa1b8b7cbfd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/52.html", "file_name": "52.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2208, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "2b064b2cca6f0c6c506bd1f09d70f95a0c2506f74861c5b70db78dae17c5e0c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "155e90bb-d92e-4a79-b601-ac5fbce205cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/519.html", "file_name": "519.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2be9ed5d-80db-4198-a70a-6d4ad9535a20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "913bf21fe65c8906a23a431737cb52700ef6fd10b16857544e78e6e158b04f14", "text": "Loading...

article on the three reasons NVIDIA should issue a stock split soon. With shares near $1,000, history says NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) will split their shares, but one question on NVIDIA investor\u2019s minds is just when this stock split will happen.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into what the timing of an NVIDIA stock split could look like.\n\nWhy NVIDIA Should Issue a Stock Split\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the reasons NVIDIA should issue a stock split, I\u2019ll quickly summarize them:\n\nThe company is trading significantly above where it issued a 4:1 stock split in the past. A stock split will make NVIDIA more accessible to retail traders A stock split could pave the way to NVIDIA being added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average\n\nAgain, you can read more details in my prior article, but the key idea here is that NVIDIA set a precedent in 2021. At the time they announced a 4:1 share split at around $600 per share and explained they were doing so to make ownership in their stock accessible to all.\n\nWith the company closing the week trading at $878.36, it\u2019s now trading at 46% above when NVIDA last announced a stock split. So, just when will they announce a split?\n\nHow Does a Company Decide on a Stock Split?\n\nOne question that might be on your mind is why hasn\u2019t NVIDIA announced a stock split yet. After all, they\u2019re trading at a price 46% higher than when they announced their last stock split!\n\nThe simple answer is that stock splits generally require board of director approval. In 2021, NVIDIA announced their stock split on May 21st, which coincided with a board vote to split the stock 4:1.\n\nHowever, the board\u2019s decision to split NVIDIA\u2019s stock wasn\u2019t final. After the board announced the stock split, NVIDIA\u2019s shareholders still had to approve the stock split. This vote happened in front of the company\u2019s Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which took place on June 3rd, 2021.\n\nWhen NVIDIA Could Announce Its Next Stock Split\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for dates when NVIDIA could announce their next stock split, here are a few to circle.\n\nLate May Announcement : The last time NVIDIA announced a dividend, it did so two weeks before its Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The company still hasn\u2019t announced its Annual Meeting of Stockholders date for 2024. In 2021, it happened on June 3rd, and last year it took place on June 22nd. So, it\u2019s likely NVIDIA could initially announce a stock split in late May to mid-June and give a couple of weeks before its Annual Meeting of Stakeholders.\n\n: The last time NVIDIA announced a dividend, it did so two weeks before its Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

However, approval isn\u2019t a final step in splitting shares. Stock Split Effective in late July: The last time NVIDIA split its shares the share split was approved by a shareholder vote on June 3rd, and the actual date spit shares were distributed was July 19th. So, if NVIDIA announces a split and shareholders approve in June\u2026 The date to circle on your calendar of when shares will actually trade at their split price is likely late July.\n\nWhy a Share Split Matters\n\nAcademically speaking, share splits don\u2019t change the value of a company. However, a trend like artificial intelligence is something that mainstream investors have latched onto. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if an NVIDIA share split drove more attention to the company and attracted more investors.\n\nIn short, the possibility of NVIDIA splitting its shares may not matter, but it won\u2019t be a negative to demand for the company\u2019s shares and could very likely be a big positive.\n\nWith all this being said, while NVIDIA has demonstrated in the past it wants to give more access to its shares and will likely issue a stock split, there are no guarantees. Between NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer (Nasdaq: SMCI), it\u2019s likely one of the market\u2019s current AI darlings will issue a stock split. The race is on to see which one will act first.\n\nTake This Retirement Quiz To Get Matched With A Financial Advisor (Sponsored) Take the quiz below to get matched with a financial advisor today.

Additionally, the Stochastic Oscillator 14 3 3 line (blue) crosses below the trigger line (orange), supporting the current price retrace.\n\nBonk 2.0 Price Prediction\n\nThe Bonk 2.0 price analysis shows that the price is currently on a downtrend but shows every sign of a rebound to the upside, supported by the formation of the falling wedge pattern, putting the current target at $0.000000060.\n\nAdditionally, the Stochastic Oscillator and the RSI have entered the oversold regions. This may signal a potential price reversal to the upside, as investors might look to increase their purchases.\n\nHowever, if the bears continue to exert more pressure, BONK2.0 may fall further to the next support zone at $0.00000002694.\n\nMeanwhile, as the BONK2.0 bulls search for entry points to propel the price higher, investors are also flocking to the 5thScape presale.\n\n5thScape: World\u2019s First AR/VR Ecosystem\n\n5thScape (5SCAPE) is the first-ever AR/VR mixed-reality crypto platform, adding crypto tokenization as a means to connect \u201cthe smartest minds together.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Embark on a journey beyond imagination with 5th Scape! \ud83c\udf08 From 3D adventures to play-to-earn excitement, it's not just gaming\u2014it's a universe of possibilities. \ud83d\ude80 Invest now for a front-row seat to the next digital frontier! \ud83c\udf10 #BeyondGaming #5thScapeAdventure pic.twitter.com/qCleJYoRrO \u2014 5th Scape (@5th_scape) January 19, 2024\n\nThe project continues to gain massive traction within the crypto space with its presale already amassing over $1.5 million as it hurtles towards a $2.5 million target.\n\nThe development team is committed to creating several VR games compatible with popular headsets, including Oculus Rift and Meta Quest 3.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

That system also lowers costs and energy consumption by up to 25 times, Nvidia said in a statement.\n\nThere was high anticipation coming into Nvidia's keynote address, and the company had been expected to roll out the Blackwell line. Shares fell 1.8% in after-hours action in a possible sell-the-news reaction.\n\nRead: Nvidia's stock could hit $1,200, this bull says. Here's the key to that rally.\n\nThe Blackwell architecture, which is named for mathematician David Harold Blackwell, replaces the Hopper architecture that Nvidia rolled out two years ago.\n\nThe company says it expects Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL), Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google, Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), OpenAI, Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) to be among adopters of the Blackwell line.\n\nDon't miss: Nvidia's stock is cheap in many ways, says this analyst who sees 34% upside\n\n\"We are committed to offering our customers the most advanced infrastructure to power their AI workloads,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"By bringing the GB200 Grace Blackwell processor to our data centers globally, we are building on our long-standing history of optimizing Nvidia GPUs for our cloud, as we make the promise of AI real for organizations everywhere.\"\n\nAmazon's AWS announced that it planned to offer the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs for customers looking to advanced generative AI capabilities.\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE), Lenovo Group Ltd. (HK:992) and Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) also plan to deliver servers based on Blackwell's lineup, Nvidia added.\n\nNvidia also mentioned that its Omniverse enterprise digital twins are coming to Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Vision Pro virtual-reality headset. Huang called Omniverse \"the operating system of the robotics world,\" and Nvidia's demo showed off a digital twin of a car.\n\n\"Spatial computing will redefine how designers and developers build captivating digital content, driving a new era of creativity and engagement,\" said Mike Rockwell, Apple's vice president of its vision products group, in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Cadence Design Systems Inc.

The solution is designed to improve user experience with on-device generative AI capabilities and advanced photography features. The latest addition to Qualcomm\u2019s premium Snapdragon 8 series is already witnessing significant market traction among leading smartphone manufacturers.\n\n\n\nMajor players in the smartphone industry, including Realme, Honor, iQOO, Redmi and Xiaomi, are expected to include the new chip in their upcoming devices, bringing a range of exceptional features to their consumers. The first device equipped with the new chip is anticipated to be announced in March.\n\n\n\nThe newly launched platform boasts advanced features such as hyper-realistic mobile gaming that provides graphics with desktop-level quality. The lossless high-definition sound ensures impressive audio clarity without any distortions. Its Snapdragon x70 5G Modem-RF system delivers the latest 5G with greater energy efficiency and faster download speed. Cognitive ISP, Snapdragon Low Light Vision features immensely enhance the user's photography experience.\n\n\n\nAll these marquee features integrated with powerful on-device generative AI will offer a personalized premium experience to customers, fostering creativity and productivity in their daily lives. The platform also supports a wide array of AI models, including large vision models and large language models such as Gemini Nano, Zhipu ChatGLM, Llama 2 and Baichuan-7B.\n\n\n\nIn November 2023, Qualcomm released Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipsets with cutting-edge AI features tailored for mid-range smartphones. The company has collaborated with prominent manufacturers to identify features most in demand in the current landscape.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the company unveiled the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen2 chip platform to support use cases in mixed reality and virtual reality applications. Its strategy to understand the evolving market dynamics and align innovation accordingly will likely give Qualcomm a competitive edge in both the mid-range and premium Android smartphone market.\n\n\n\nQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. The company is focusing on retaining its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological achievements and innovative product launches.\n\n\n\nQualcomm is reportedly the only chipset vendor with 5G system-level solutions spanning sub-6 and millimeter wave bands and one of the most extensive RF (radio frequency) front-end suppliers with design wins across all premium-tier smartphone customers. With the rollout of the 5G technology, it is benefiting from investment toward building a licensing program in mobile. The company is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets, driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream.\n\n\n\nShares of the company have gained 37% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 16.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 20.18%.

While there are many companies shaping the AI narrative, I would argue that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is cast in the lead role.\n\nThe company's breakthroughs in compute networking are impacting a multitude of AI applications, including machine learning, generative AI, and large language models (LLMs). Nvidia is currently the nucleus of most systems powering modern AI tools, and investors have been cheering on the stock. Over the last year, shares have surged by 265%.\n\nWith Nvidia stock hovering in the vicinity of the all-time high it set earlier this month, some investors may be wondering if they've missed out on the chance to profit. My stance? Given all the moves Nvidia is making and the ways it's setting itself up for long-term growth, now is as lucrative a time as ever to scoop up some shares.\n\nA meteoric rise\n\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's quarterly revenues, gross profits, and free cash flows over the last decade.\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNot only are sales skyrocketing, but Nvidia's commanding position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) and data center business has provided the company with unparalleled pricing power. This has helped it expand its margins materially -- improvements that flow directly to the bottom line.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia increased its free cash flow sixfold. Unsurprisingly, this level of growth has brought Nvidia onto the radar of more investors. Ultimately, this has resulted in more buying activity -- leading to an eye-popping addition of $1 trillion to Nvidia's market cap in less than two months.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has loads of cash, and it's not afraid to spend it\n\nPowered by its record performance in 2023, Nvidia has doubled the cash position on its balance sheet to $26 billion. While this is impressive, what I find more encouraging is how Nvidia is allocating its capital.\n\nThe company is showing a keen interest in AI software applications. Namely, the company has investments in voice-recognition company SoundHound AI as well as data analytics start-up Databricks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough it primarily develops hardware, Nvidia is quietly making inroads into enterprise software. Its software services business reached an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion last year -- a great milestone, but still much smaller than its $47 billion compute networking business.\n\nNvidia also joined Microsoft, OpenAI, Intel, and Jeff Bezos in a recent funding round for a start-up called Figure AI, which is developing humanoid robots that it plans to commercialize in manufacturing, warehousing, and even retail settings.\n\nNvidia stands to benefit from this relationship in several ways. Specifically, it is uniquely positioned to help further the development of Figure AI's bots from both a hardware and software standpoint.\n\nThe stock is expensive, but worth the premium\n\nIn the wake of the surge in Nvidia's stock, the company's valuation multiples have become a bit extended. Shares trade at 77 times trailing-12-month earnings. Moreover, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 is nearly double that of the S&P 500.\n\nDespite its ultra-premium valuation, I see Nvidia's stock as a solid opportunity for long-term investors. At a macro level, heavy secular tailwinds fuel AI budgets, and I don't expect those to abate anytime soon.\n\nBased on Nvidia's ability to market itself as both a hardware and software solution, as well as the potential of its savvy investments, I see its journey as just starting.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3628, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d710b6f-2e49-4663-9265-4181866893df": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d710b6f-2e49-4663-9265-4181866893df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/537.html", "file_name": "537.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5064, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e0e27e9-2423-4c20-b7fe-3ba667c82629", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/537.html", "file_name": "537.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5064, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "516383cc1cdc6b3617e4dced9cb3fccec540b7fc733cfa0d5fa81739f802d826", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dccef697-4b51-4245-b47e-1d39699f58e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/537.html", "file_name": "537.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5064, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "bf31dbff04c5c1a90f6396d0a7d1a96ba5f5d60723b0488889eec304069640b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e51b57f-9db1-4b61-93a1-8527adf46fd3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a624be0df62644cb69c499e9d11efe6cf5e62730528a1bd6a23c8ee19486961", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c20ca4f1a91995ac6b12d251fc7f10267b54f0c5f11b35631014327b08083c8b", "text": "Shares trade at 77 times trailing-12-month earnings.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

TheStreet / Shutterstock\n\nTreasury bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, often rise in concert with higher inflation expectations. Investors sell bonds due to concern that inflation will erode the value of future coupon and principal payments.\n\nBond-market whispers\n\nThat certainly seemed a factor in last week's sale of $117 billion in new bonds from the Treasury, including a $39 billion auction of benchmark 10-year notes, which drew muted interest from foreign investors and a overall decline in demand from domestic investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBenchmark 2-year notes, the most-sensitive to interest rate changes, have risen around 12 basis points in the past month to 4.734%, in a move that suggests the Fed will likely maintain its current lending rate deeper in the summer months.\n\nThe CME Group's FedWatch, in fact, pegs the chances of June rate cut at just 56%, having priced in more than a 70% chance in early February, and expects no action from the Fed this week or in May.\n\nThe reasons are fairly straightforward but have been largely ignored by the stock market: Inflation is proving stubbornly difficult to return to the Fed's 2% target. It ticked modestly higher last month as rent and food prices continued to rise.\n\nRelated: Jobs report signals soft landing as hiring hits 275,000 and wage gains ease\n\n\"While inflation has softened considerably, it may take longer than expected to reach the Fed's target,\" said Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management in Flower Mound, Texas.\n\n\"We expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in June, but a lot can happen in three months when it comes to the economy, and even the slightest reacceleration of inflation can push the Federal Reserve to stand down on rate cuts and revisit them towards the end of 2024,\" he added.\n\nRelated: Retail sales rebound and factory inflation spikes, muddling Fed rate forecasts\n\nThe economy, meanwhile, is growing at a 2.3% clip, having expanded 3.2% over the final months of last year and 4.9% over the three months ended in October.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3765, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc42f60a-5d73-474d-ac19-5ae314d5e3a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc42f60a-5d73-474d-ac19-5ae314d5e3a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/545.html", "file_name": "545.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6093, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73c24fdd-58e2-43ee-8b45-14e112dc2667", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/545.html", "file_name": "545.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6093, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "4a74a6fc9274beb407ff8f3d03227ed742287c9ad858e3d612b84155d9019c73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdd86f57-7cb6-4149-9836-5d356d82458f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/545.html", "file_name": "545.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6093, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "167741eca2307630db4f6f116fe34213377ae6750c8b52a4c0b6fbcb5413c55b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4a0f6fd-9135-476a-9319-75cb42b8be7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afe5a108e272cf4f519e261dd340ed9c0737cabace3a1ca9a08fac99486368c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cff340852d5ec8f98958cd30a076f7f91b26d5880a5b875f19715e684e366f2e", "text": "\"We expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in June, but a lot can happen in three months when it comes to the economy, and even the slightest reacceleration of inflation can push the Federal Reserve to stand down on rate cuts and revisit them towards the end of 2024,\" he added.\n\nRelated: Retail sales rebound and factory inflation spikes, muddling Fed rate forecasts\n\nThe economy, meanwhile, is growing at a 2.3% clip, having expanded 3.2% over the final months of last year and 4.9% over the three months ended in October.\n\nRetail sales are also on the mend, rebounding from January's post-holiday lull to rise 0.6% a collective total of $700.7 billion.

As the demand for Nvidia's cards has increased, Supermicro has also witnessed a terrific jump in demand for its server solutions, leading to rapid growth in the company's top and bottom lines.\n\nSMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAnd now, a recent revelation from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggests that Supermicro's eye-popping growth will continue.\n\nNvidia's adoption of liquid-cooled systems should give Super Micro Computer a boost\n\nNvidia's current flagship AI graphics card, the H100, reportedly performs well under air cooling. What's more, the upcoming H200 processor is also anticipated to perform optimally while being air-cooled, according to Tom's Hardware. But at an economic summit at Stanford this week, Huang said that one of Nvidia's next-generation computers is going to be liquid-cooled.\n\nNvidia's next-generation AI graphics processing units (GPUs) based on the Blackwell architecture are expected to consume 40% more power than the existing offerings based on the Hopper architecture. According to some other claims, Nvidia's next-generation AI chips could even consume double the power of the current lineup. This is where liquid-cooled server systems are going to come into the picture.\n\nWhen launching what Supermicro claimed to be the first liquid-cooled server systems for Nvidia's H100 processors last year, the company said:\n\nSavings for a data center are estimated to be 40% for power when using Supermicro liquid cooling solutions compared to an air-cooled data center. In addition, up to 86% reduction in direct cooling costs compared to existing data centers may be realized.\n\nStory continues\n\nA look at third-party studies suggests something similar. Liquid cooling reportedly consumes just 20% of the energy required for air cooling. In other words, liquid cooling is known to reduce energy consumption in data centers significantly, while also helping reduce operating expenses by using less water than air-cooled data centers.\n\nSupermicro seems to have been ahead of the curve, as it took the initiative to launch liquid-cooling solutions for Nvidia's AI chips last year. The company is now working to boost the manufacturing capacity of liquid-cooled server racks. On its January earnings conference call, Supermicro management remarked: \"By this June quarter, we will have high-volume, dedicated capacity for manufacturing 100-kilowatt to 120-kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, providing DLC, direct liquid cooling racks capacity, up to 1,500 racks per month, and our total rack production capacity will be up to 5,000 racks per month by then.\"\n\nThe company's focus on expanding its capacity of liquid-cooled servers will not only let it take advantage of Nvidia's power-hungry AI chips but also allow it to make a dent in the fast-growing market for liquid-cooled data centers as a whole. The liquid-cooled data center market is expected to generate annual revenue of $40 billion in 2033, compared with just $4.5 billion last year, clocking an annual growth rate of 24% over the next decade.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see Supermicro maintaining its healthy pace of growth for a long time to come.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3552, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef826fce-6d53-4a17-b329-07ff78372938": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef826fce-6d53-4a17-b329-07ff78372938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/547.html", "file_name": "547.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5523, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21ba7150-2cf8-4cb0-917d-53661bceef26", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/547.html", "file_name": "547.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5523, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "7d23698e3c5aebdaa656cea51d5dcd3cda2f86389d56c60f4066aafb8aa93578", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4a0f6fd-9135-476a-9319-75cb42b8be7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/547.html", "file_name": "547.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5523, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "afe5a108e272cf4f519e261dd340ed9c0737cabace3a1ca9a08fac99486368c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "020ec735-4b76-41a1-a35d-870e6c44ce44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8008ee45d865ad4a5193ee56d3e16ad790c8a181c82d955a259d16a6db9f804f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5d98cd78a07eda624c31a2747aecef0ee8b3edfe22f43284673aae1ce6639398", "text": "The company's focus on expanding its capacity of liquid-cooled servers will not only let it take advantage of Nvidia's power-hungry AI chips but also allow it to make a dent in the fast-growing market for liquid-cooled data centers as a whole.

Since then, many companies in and outside of tech have been working on developing their AI capabilities to take advantage of next-gen technologies. And valuations have also risen with any stocks able to cash in from that.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an easy example of that, with its market cap hitting more than $2 trillion this year. The company has been achieving strong top and bottom-line growth thanks to the growing popularity of AI. However, at more than 70 times earnings, some investors may be worried that Nvidia and other AI stocks are in what could just be today's version of the dot-com bubble.\n\nOne of the smartest businesspeople in the world, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, however, believes that AI is the real deal, and that it isn't just hype.\n\nWhy this isn't the dot-com bubble all over again\n\nWhat makes artificial intelligence exciting is that virtually any industry can benefit from it. Whether it's automating processes or doing analysis more efficiently and effectively, there's plenty of potential for just about any business to use AI to its advantage.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Dimon said he believes that AI has the potential to \"be used in almost every job.\" And his visions for AI go beyond just helping companies make better forecasts or tracking inventory levels. He said, \"It may invent cancer cures because it can do things that the human mind simply cannot do.\"\n\nUnlike the dot-com bubble where there was a lot of hype and not much substance, AI is already proving to be a game changer for many businesses. And while adoption levels will vary, Dimon believes this time around the excitement isn't getting ahead of the results.\n\nIn many cases, there's a good reason behind rising valuations\n\nNvidia and many other tech businesses are benefiting from AI as they are seeing demand for their products and services soar. Whether it's a greater need for data centers or companies seeking AI chips, Nvidia's business has been red hot. With risky dot-com businesses, they weren't profitable or making much money and yet their shares were soaring in value.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Nvidia's case, the business has been doing exceptionally well. Not only is revenue climbing, but profits have also been skyrocketing. In the company's most recent fiscal year, which ended on Jan. 28, Nvidia reported revenue of $60.9 billion, which grew by 126% year over year. Net income of $29.8 billion was nearly seven times the $4.4 billion that Nvidia reported in profit in the previous fiscal year.\n\nIt makes sense for Nvidia's stock to soar, given such impressive figures. This isn't a risky dot-com business; it's an industry leader in the tech world that stands to benefit from AI's continued growth. The biggest issue is just how much growth is too optimistic when it comes to the company's expected future earnings.

At the same time, many of the companies whose shares soared in previous market booms eventually saw their stock prices fizzle, a fate that may await some of the market\u2019s current AI favorites.\n\nFor now, investors are responding with enthusiasm and Nvidia - whose chips are seen as the gold standard in AI - continues to grab the spotlight.\n\nThe assets of the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which seeks to deliver twice the daily return of the chipmaker\u2019s shares and is not included in Morningstar\u2019s data on AI-themed funds, doubled to $2 billion earlier this month. Those flows have followed the nearly 80% climb in Nvidia's shares so far this year, after the company's shares tripled in 2023.\n\nAt its developer conference on Monday, the company unveiled the Blackwell B200, an AI chip it says is up to 30 times speedier than its previous chip.\n\nNVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang displays products on-stage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, California, on March 18, 2024.

Assets in the Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF tripled to about $20 million from $7.5 million earlier this month, said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeven of the 18 diversified AI-related ETFs that Morningstar tracks have launched within the last three years. An eighth was redesigned to target AI more directly.\n\nThe funds have had collective inflows of $2.68 billion in the last 12 months, according to Morningstar. That is almost double the inflows into global real estate ETFs, the company said.\n\nWhether investor excitement about the possibilities of AI is fueling a bubble or just contributing to a strong bull run in stocks is unclear.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 8% year-to-date, fueled in part by rallies in AI beneficiaries such as Nvidia and Microsoft, following a 24% gain last year. The AI fervor has also driven parabolic moves in the shares of other companies, including a more than 250% gain in Super Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 this week.\n\nSome investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves.

Less obvious beneficiaries included Walmart and Caterpillar. The bank also recommended exploring \"less crowded sub-themes\" like the integration of AI and smartphones.\n\nETFs are also scrambling to provide offerings for every taste. Robo Global Robotics & Automation ETF supplements its Nvidia exposure with holdings in stocks some expect to benefit from AI technology, like Intuitive Surgical. The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF is focusing on companies it expects to be beneficiaries of generative AI, including Salesforce.com and Marvell Technology.\n\nStill, at least one flavor of AI-themed ETF has failed to win fans.

The International Energy Agency last week surprised global markets by predicting worldwide oil supplies could fall short of demand by 300,000 barrels per day this year. Previously, the IEA predicted a surplus of 800,000 barrels per day. The IEA said global demand in the first quarter would rise by 1.7 million barrels per day, more than previously expected. Meanwhile, production likely will fall by 870,000 barrels per day, reflecting curbs in production that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other nations, together known as OPEC+, extended earlier this month. Rebel attacks in the Red Sea have disrupted shipping lanes, diverting tankers to longer routes. That means more oil inventory remains stuck at sea. At the same time, the IEA estimated onshore global stocks had sunk to their lowest level in eight years. The changing supply and demand picture caused the U.S. Energy Information Administration to raise its projection for average U.S. gasoline prices this year to about $3.50 per gallon, up almost 20 cents from its forecast a month ago.\n\n-Lyle Niedens\n\nTesla Stock Jumps After EV Maker Raises Model Y Prices Tesla (TSLA) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Monday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker announced that it was raising the price of its most popular model, the Model Y. The company posted on its website that the cost of the mid-size SUV would increase by $1,000 on April 1. Tesla already boosted Model Y prices by $1,000 on March 1 on its real-wheel and long-range versions, putting them at their current base price of $43,990 and $48,990, respectively. Both qualify for the $7,500 EV federal tax credit. Tesla has struggled as EV demand slumps and competition increases.

The Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan (BOJ), two of the world\u2019s most influential central banks, will both make monetary policy decisions this week, raising the prospect that stocks could get a policy-induced jolt or two. Fed watchers will be scrutinizing the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s quarterly dot plots, which represent policymakers\u2019 expectations for the U.S. economy and Fed policy. Meanwhile, some analysts are raising bets the BOJ will increase interest rates for the first time in 17 years when it concludes its March meeting tomorrow. Both events will likely move markets. Though, as Morgan Stanley analysts pointed out in a note Monday, equity markets have been unusually indifferent to rising Treasury yields so far this year. Equities rallied through the last three months of 2023 as Treasury yields tumbled and equity multiples increased. \u201cFast forward to this year,\u201d the analysts wrote, \u201cand the story has been much different. Bond yields have risen considerably since the beginning of the year as market participants have moved away from the long end and the Fed walked back several of the cuts that had been priced in for this year.\u201d And yet P/E multiples have remained elevated. \u201cThis informs us that, for now, equity investors appear to have moved past the Fed, inflation and rates,\u201d they said, to focus on higher growth expectations. This week\u2019s Fed and BOJ decisions could put the equity and bond market\u2019s divergence to the test. According to MS analysts: \u201cThe correlation of small cap performance versus interest rates remains meaningfully negative (-0.4),\" meaning small caps are likely to be hit harder than large caps by a jump in yields. \"Conversely, should rates decisively fall back below the 200-day moving average, it could serve as support for equity valuations to remain elevated.\u201d\n\nLogitech Shares Fall After CFO Resigns Logitech International (LOGI) shares fell Monday after the Swiss computer accessories maker said its chief financial officer (CFO), Charles Boynton, will be stepping down after just over a year in the role. The company said Boyton is leaving \"to pursue another career opportunity.\" He will remain with Logitech as CFO through mid-May \u201cto ensure a seamless transition for the end of the 2024 fiscal year,\" the Swiss company said, adding it would name Boynton\u2019s successor at a later date. Boynton has been in the role only since Feb. 2023.

During his keynote address at Nvidia\u2019s GTC developer conference in San Jose, Calif., CEO Jensen Huang laid out a vision of a world where A.I. can be used to optimize any system, physical or digital, to improve its performance.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

In the middle of the conference, a sort of tech trade show with over 20,000 attendees, the entire crowd suddenly left the San Jose Convention Center and walked nearly a half mile through downtown San Jose to the SAP Center to see Huang\u2019s keynote address. The crowd making this trek was so massive that it blocked all downtown traffic for almost an hour.\n\nOnstage, Huang laid out one of the most ambitious and comprehensive game plans ever set forth in the technology industry. He first unveiled a next-generation processor called Blackwell, which is orders of magnitude more powerful than its predecessors. The first Blackwell-based chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year.\n\nThe monolithic chip, or rather chip set, is a massive object (about the size of a retail shirt box, but much heavier) containing 32 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs that can be used alone or connected in groups ranging from two to several thousand Blackwell units, conceivably filling a warehouse-sized building much like today\u2019s internet server farms, all operating as a single, monolithic system.\n\nEach Blackwell unit includes a new Nvidia Omniverse AI software system and a new Nvidia Inference Microservice (NIM), which is the digital equivalent of a team of specialized systems analysts. Unlike a systems analyst, who must meticulously study systems one by one to analyze and test how they can be made better and safer, the NIM directs a \u201cNeMo Retriever\u201d\u2014 which is like a very sophisticated bot or computer virus\u2014to immerse itself into the system and create a \u201cdigital double\u201d of that system within the Omniverse AI\u2014including physical specifications and any software it finds. For example, the NeMo Retriever could create a digital double of a hospital and then compute various ways to optimize and improve the entire operation, from the physical infrastructure of the building itself to the radiology set-up or sample testing software in the oncology department.\n\n\u201cThe system takes in the data, learns its meaning, and then reindexes it into the Omniverse AI database, where it can talk to and improve the system,\u201d Huang said during his keynote. \u201cIt can extract a document such as a PDF and encode it, where it becomes a set of vectors which can be tested.\u201d\n\nThe Omniverse system itself even has a digital double, enabling it to detect, for example, if a single GPU within a Blackwell monolithic chipset is faulty and needs to be replaced. Because it relies on advanced A.I. technology and has a \u201cprime objective\u201d of digitally doubling nearly everything in its environment, the platform is flexible enough to produce results across a wide range of industries. But it is also attuned to important findings such as confidential and proprietary data, said Huang.\n\nIn one health care application, for example, Nvidia has a NIM called Diane. \u201cShe is a digital human NIM, or more accurately, a Hippocratic AI or LLM for the healthcare market,\u201d Huang explained. The result of all of this optimization, Huang said, will be \u201ca massive upgrade to the world\u2019s A.I.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3900, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1b63602-4030-469e-870c-2da48a619794": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1b63602-4030-469e-870c-2da48a619794", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/61.html", "file_name": "61.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5392, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5041ebac-19c0-48e6-9258-f1ebc409679e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/61.html", "file_name": "61.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5392, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "bd33721e5358c40317fcbfc4d0a6a4ede14233d32abf05a0a06dd7a357d762ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3db40191-96db-44ca-88be-d6af141661a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/61.html", "file_name": "61.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5392, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "0646df623afc29e752ff97df21d2ebe4ffe7b79642e16ff798e705cb379d722a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4247dff9-6c42-4da0-9978-7673b57d541d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59fa96418246b30c4b3fe7cafbe7038e15161c65993bb97c2b45c6fd64a0f6a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d0699a79a9d21a009bbe989f84e878aaf7251a3bfc4060ce24aba863e010cef0", "text": "Because it relies on advanced A.I. technology and has a \u201cprime objective\u201d of digitally doubling nearly everything in its environment, the platform is flexible enough to produce results across a wide range of industries.

Huang indicated Nvidia is already well down that road. For example, in a surprise announcement, Huang said Apple (AAPL) is collaborating to integrate the Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse into Apple\u2019s Vision Pro VR headset. He also revealed that TSMC, the world\u2019s leading semiconductor foundry, will manufacture Blackwell chipsets. In addition, Siemens Industries is helping Nvidia build the digital metaverse, while Dell will be the first computer systems provider to incorporate the new A.I. into its systems.\n\nHuang also touted enterprise consulting partners such as SAP, ServiceNow, Cohesity, NetApp and Snowflake. \u201cThe service industry is sitting on a gold mine,\u201d Huang said.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple, which was thought to be out of the A.I. game altogether, published a paper yesterday about a new A.I. model called MM1. MM1 consists of a family of multimodal models supporting up to 30 billion parameters featuring enhanced in-context learning and multi-image and chain-of-thought reasoning.\n\nAlso yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Apple is in talks to integrate Google\u2019s Gemini A.I. into future iPhones. Gemini is already being integrated into Samsung phones and tablets. Bloomberg\u2019s sources said Apple had also been in talks with OpenAI to use its technology in new iPhones, but Google is a more likely partner.

The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, spanning two days, commences on Tuesday, with outcomes expected on Wednesday. Earlier today, the Bank of Japan abandoned its longstanding negative interest rate policy, contributing to market jitters ahead of the Fed\u2019s decision. With no major catalysts driving the market, pre-Fed session nerves may keep sentiment subdued.\n\nCues From Previous Session:\n\nOn Monday, a resurgence in tech stocks, fueled by Nvidia Corp.\u2019s NVDA GPU 2024 developer\u2019s conference and potential partnerships involving Apple, Inc.

Shares of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF peaked last week. The fund added almost 80% in gains in the last year and 30% in 2024 alone.\n\nAlso read: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin Unsure Of AI Market Bubble But Says Nvidia \u2018Sits In A Pretty Good Position\u2019 Now: \u2018Really On Top Of Their Game\u2019\n\nOther ETFs following the industry show a similar trajectory. iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, the second-largest semiconductor ETF after VanEck by total assets, grew 58% in the past year and 19% since January.\n\nDirexion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares SOXL, ranking third in total assets among its peers, stands out as the top performer. As a leveraged ETF aiming to amplify the industry\u2019s growth threefold, the fund has surged by 183% over the past year, with a notable 53% increase since the beginning of January alone.\n\nWhile the industry saw a slight downtick this week, ETFs following the sector have benefited significantly from the recent tech rally, which counted semiconductor stocks among some of its biggest winners.\n\nNVIDIA Corp NVDA, which has been consistently referred to as the real winner of the AI race, has led the rally, accumulating more than 80% in growth since January. Nvidia's first mover advantage in developing high-end chips made to train artificial intelligence models has been welcomed by investors with open arms.\n\nLoading...

AMD also showcases remarkable \u2014yet more moderate\u2014 growth, having added 33% in gains since the start of the year.\n\nTop chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. TSM follow's AMD's trajectory closely, adding 37% since January.

AAPL supplier Taiwan\u2019s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF, operating as Foxconn, is looking to capitalize on the AI server market through a strategic partnership with Nvidia Corp. NVDA, according to a prominent analyst.\n\nWhat Happened: Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, on Thursday shared his insights on Nvidia\u2019s AI server market strategy. Kuo noted that Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, is expected to benefit from a closer partnership with Nvidia in the long run.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that Nvidia has recently altered its GB200 development strategy, investing more in its system development and \u201creducing its dependance\u201d on Hon Hai/Ingrasys\u2019 GB200 development.\n\nThis shift may have led to an overly optimistic market view of Hon Hai/Ingrasys\u2019 system development advantages, order visibility, and GPM in GB200.\n\n\u201cGB200\u201d is a GPU that is tailored for use in data centers. It was unveiled by the company in October as part of its AI product strategy for 2024 and 2025.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Now Is NOT The Time To Throw In The Towel\u2019 On Tesla, Says Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives: AI And FSD Could Drive The Stock Over $1 Trillion\n\nKuo also highlighted that the current shipment visibility of GB200 is not high, and it is currently difficult for most suppliers to estimate the actual contribution. Customer concerns about adopting Grace are one of the main reasons for the current low visibility of GB200 shipments.\n\n\u201cCustomer concerns about adopting Grace are: 1) the ROI of continuing to build AI computing power and 2) the bargaining power against Nvidia will continue to erode in the long term,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhy It Matters: Foxconn\u2019s move to tap into the AI server market comes at a time when the company is experiencing a revenue dip due to a quieter market demand. In January earlier this year, the Apple supplier forecasted a decline in first-quarter revenue following a slow market demand in the last quarter.\n\nThe first quarter tends to be slower for tech companies like Foxconn, following the busy holiday season when they supply electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets.\n\nLoading...

AAPL and Tesla Inc. TSLA if TikTok is banned or sold in the U.S.\n\nWhat Happened: On Friday, Munster took to X, formerly Twitter, to express his views on the potential consequences of the ongoing TikTok saga. He also reiterated his earlier estimates saying, \u201cI have the odds at 50% nothing happens to TikTok, 25% sale and 25% ban.\u201d\n\nMunster believes that if TikTok is forced to sell or banned, the Chinese government could accuse U.S. tech companies of using their products for espionage. \u201cI believe if there is a forced sale or ban of TikTok, Chinese leadership will argue US tech companies are using their products to spy on the Chinese.\u201d\n\nThe managing partner then pointed out the significant revenue that U.S. tech companies generate from China, with Tesla accounting for about 23%, Apple at 18%, and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA at 8%.\n\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\n\nHe concluded by saying that despite being caught in U.S.-China tensions, Apple has historically received significant support from Chinese leadership. However, if the TikTok divestiture becomes law, it could potentially impact iPhone and Tesla sales in China.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line: if the TikTok divestiture becomes law, there\u2019ll likely be modest pressure on China iPhone sales and Tesla sales,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhy It Matters: Munster\u2019s comments come amid the ongoing debate over the future of TikTok in the U.S. Earlier this week, Munster echoed former President Donald Trump\u2018s views on the TikTok ban, saying if the social media platform indeed got banned in the U.S., Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s could gain a significant advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, Munster\u2019s colleague and the other managing partner at Deepwater, Doug Clinton, has a different view on the potential outcome of the TikTok ban. Clinton believes that the most likely outcome is a sale, contrary to Munster\u2019s prediction of a 25% chance of a sale.\n\nPrice Action: Apple closed at $172.62 on Friday, down 0.22% from the previous close, while Tesla stock closed at $163.57, up 0.66% from the previous close, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: \u2018I'm Shocked': Gene Munster Recants Prediction As Apple Kills Electric Car Project\n\nImage by oasisamuel on Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2554, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37d4b975-584f-47cb-a3f5-27efaebfbac2": {"__data__": {"id_": "37d4b975-584f-47cb-a3f5-27efaebfbac2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/628.html", "file_name": "628.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "16fa400f-b4f1-413f-a4dc-71d362da74d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/628.html", "file_name": "628.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5de1c0c7627c9ebac6b8ba55c38166150f8e7b9c1c58fcb180770918416d54e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "451882c8-cede-46b1-bac3-b0de939b23f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/627.html", "file_name": "627.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2584, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "39504dd83c3a1de59c6b2e9fe347c593f6a2ff23627327575bd701e9d554a7c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33983daa-8ba3-4095-b8a7-0fefcb5cae18", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "12fb82be6f8a3c1d0e170d6f5bc23956e3a6e87dd3f7fca395ffc8021b05e451", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "73295b71968f3e1f875bba6cc33edf703321b6949dcf2196385c06594c849c25", "text": "It hasn't been easy to be a stock investor in recent years, with more market volatility than usual.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic saw many stocks skyrocket in 2021 as homebound consumers invested in home offices and entertainment products. However, an economic downturn in 2022 brought the market crashing back down and led many companies' shares to lose what they had gained the year before.\n\nThen, in 2023, the market once again swung in the opposite direction, with the Nasdaq Composite climbing 43%. Excitement over tech and artificial intelligence (AI) prompted an impressive recovery. And the same index is up about 8% in 2024, seemingly breaking the yo-yo-like pattern that has occurred in recent years.\n\nHowever, recent volatility highlights the importance of investing in stocks with a long-term mindset. Those who sold in 2022 will not have profited from the swift rise many stocks enjoyed in 2023 and continue to see this year.\n\nAs a result, now is an excellent time to fortify your portfolio by investing in companies likely to deliver consistent gains long into the future. So, here are two hypergrowth stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nTech stocks have surged over the last year thanks to a boom in AI. According to Grand View Research, the industry hit close to $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. This trajectory would see the AI market reach a valuation nearing $2 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has cornered the market on AI chips. Last year, the tech giant achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary to train and run AI models. Nvidia's success in the industry has seen its stock increase 294% over the last year alongside soaring earnings.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen 207%, while operating income has skyrocketed 536%. Additionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% to more than $27 billion. For reference, rival chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel posted free cash flow of $1 billion and negative $14 billion last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both chipmakers, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Nvidia's stock is potentially trading at its best value in months, with its price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios declining by double digits since last July. These are helpful metrics in determining a stock's value, with the lower figure representing the better the value.\n\nAlongside a lucrative role in AI, Nvidia is a hypergrowth stock worth considering in 2024 and beyond.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a tech behemoth with a market cap of $1.8 billion, making it the world's fifth most valuable company. Since its founding almost 30 years ago, the retail giant has expanded to multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nThe company was one of the hardest hit in 2022, as spikes in inflation curbed consumer spending and caused its stock to plunge 50% during the challenging year. However, Amazon pulled off an impressive turnaround last year, which has proven the value of its stock as a long-term hold.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3479, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33983daa-8ba3-4095-b8a7-0fefcb5cae18": {"__data__": {"id_": "33983daa-8ba3-4095-b8a7-0fefcb5cae18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/628.html", "file_name": "628.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "16fa400f-b4f1-413f-a4dc-71d362da74d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/628.html", "file_name": "628.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5de1c0c7627c9ebac6b8ba55c38166150f8e7b9c1c58fcb180770918416d54e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "37d4b975-584f-47cb-a3f5-27efaebfbac2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/628.html", "file_name": "628.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5647, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "73295b71968f3e1f875bba6cc33edf703321b6949dcf2196385c06594c849c25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2da70f2f-da2c-4ca6-b71c-7f03af722766", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "26a7a77a91cb8a48921c72575a2db4c5be2ef605f05729b37c08a0b780d2bbc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "12fb82be6f8a3c1d0e170d6f5bc23956e3a6e87dd3f7fca395ffc8021b05e451", "text": "2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a tech behemoth with a market cap of $1.8 billion, making it the world's fifth most valuable company.

However, Amazon pulled off an impressive turnaround last year, which has proven the value of its stock as a long-term hold.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year, with operating income more than tripling to $37 billion. Various cost-cutting moves brought profitability back to its retail segments. Meanwhile, the company's dominating position in the cloud market with Amazon Web Services granted it a promising role in AI. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nAMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by Amazon's forward P/E of 42, you get a stock price of $294.\n\nFrom its current position, this would see Amazon's stock rise 66% over the next two fiscal years. Alongside dominating positions in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon's stock is worth buying right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Gerber believes that Apple\u2019s focus on Vision Pro and Gen AI will lead to significant stock growth.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts have suggested that Apple is at a crossroads and must step up its game in the AI space to avoid being left behind.\n\nThe integration of Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse with Apple Vision Pro\u2019s high-resolution displays could be a step in the right direction for Apple\u2019s AI ambitions.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Apple's stock was up 0.27% at $174.19 in Tuesday's premarket trading, while Nvidia's stock was down 2.43% to $863.02, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Sam Altman Laughs Off Speculation About OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever\u2019s Whereabouts: \u2018I Really Hope We Work Together For\u2026Rest Of My Career\u2019\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Nvidia", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3130, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bccd02eb-d7d1-45a1-8a11-df447ceb4166": {"__data__": {"id_": "bccd02eb-d7d1-45a1-8a11-df447ceb4166", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/64.html", "file_name": "64.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3283, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7a06ee81-aeb2-4e3f-9023-c3050a6b47c6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/64.html", "file_name": "64.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3283, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "36fa51f24b3daf924e836c039f6192bcad2c4708f82d70feac8d2db051ef8406", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2da70f2f-da2c-4ca6-b71c-7f03af722766", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/63.html", "file_name": "63.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3170, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "26a7a77a91cb8a48921c72575a2db4c5be2ef605f05729b37c08a0b780d2bbc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "97bd5041-c7d1-4b77-9252-6aa0b4f942d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0382036a6ae3231444d9915f6339b3d63aa65a58188b4969fcee67ca4a7f929", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b8099ce5705dd13d5f4c36585f72259a44908d30589c62868e6cf44d35ae6717", "text": "Why AMD (AMD) Shares Are Falling Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 6.3% in the morning session after competitor Nvidia announced a new AI chip family called Blackwell at its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC). NVDA's event raised the bar for the industry. For instance, the company gave a specific example of a 75% reduction in power consumption for an LLM training project on Blackwell vs Hopper, an existing chip line. In addition, NVDA is also investing heavily into and making quick progress in the areas of services, omniverse, and robotics. To keep pace, competitors may need to invest more or face reduced market share.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nAMD's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 23 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 26 days ago, when the company gained 10.9% as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia's outstanding earnings results. During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications. Guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.\n\nAMD is up 30.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $181.04 per share it is still trading 14.4% below its 52-week high of $211.38 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $6,970.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future.

Currently, the Dow is +98 points, the S&P 500 is +43 and the Nasdaq +226 points. Apparently, market participants are expecting good things for the tech sector this week.\n\n\n\nThe biggest news we expect is a new report from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), beginning Tuesday and finishing up Wednesday \u2014 after which we will head from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at a press conference. No one is expecting the Fed to move from its current 5.25-5.50% interest rate level, but we do expect a new \u201cdot-plot,\u201d which will be used as a sort of road map for potential cuts throughout the remainder of 2024. Currently, the first rate cut is expected at the June meeting, which is two meetings from now.\n\n\n\nBond yields are up on both the 2-year and 10-year \u2014 4.726% and 4.320%, respectively \u2014 keeping the roughly 40-basis-point (bps) inversion, where we\u2019ve been for most of the past couple years. These days, the inversion itself is not the big story (even though yield-curve inversions do tend to pre-date recessions, lest we forget), it\u2019s the rate of change on both. Previously, with expectations of Fed rate cuts coming as soon as this week\u2019s meeting (which they won\u2019t), bind yields had been recessing notably \u2014 certainly from the 5% range, which correlated with the last time a bear market had taken hold of equities (last fall).\n\n\n\nAside from the FOMC meeting, we get some housing data this week: the Homebuilder Confidence Survey for February after the opening bell today, Housing Starts and Building Permits tomorrow, and Existing Home Dales for February on Thursday. In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s not a hugely consequential week for economic data, but every little drib and drab helps us prepare for the immediate future.\n\n\n\nAlso, although Q4 earnings season has been exhausted \u2014 and once again better than expected, overall, which has helped markets progress thus far year to date (last week notwithstanding), we do see some companies reporting this week of some note: FedEx FDX \u2014 not only a major transportation and logistics firm, but a gauge on global consumption; it\u2019s our first look at Q1 consumer appetite \u2014 NIKE NKE and Micron MU. The Q1 earnings season doesn\u2019t really ramp up for another four weeks.\n\n\n\nLater today, NVIDIA NVDA co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote address on A.I. technology at this year\u2019s GTC summit (GTC stands for GPU [which stands for Graphics Processing Unit, used in everything from crypto to video games] Technology Conference) in San Jose, CA. Huang is one of the most important innovators of this century, so when he offers his views on artificial intelligence, it will be of high importance for investors, particularly those in the tech space.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street already expects that Nvidia (NVDA) will debut its new B100 chip and talk up the broader market opportunities for accelerated computing.\n\n\"With the expected step up in performance, we are looking for any details around Nvidia's pricing plans,\" Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \"As a reminder the transition from the A100 to H100 saw NVDA pricing more than double.\"\n\nHe'll also be looking for additional demand indications on the B100, beyond management's recent prediction that early demand for \"next-generation\" products would significantly outstrip supply. And he'll be watching for indications about Nvidia's product roadmap looking beyond 2025.\n\nHe bumped his price target up to $1,000 from $850 in his Thursday morning report, while keeping an outperform rating. Analysts from Evercore ISI and BofA Securities hiked their own price targets earlier this week.\n\nDon't miss: Why Nvidia's explosive stock gains aren't over yet, according to BofA\n\nNvidia's stock has enjoyed a meteoric run, rising 265% over the past year and 77% so far in 2024. But while the shares at one point seemed near invincible given a string of strong daily rallies unconnected to new information, the stock is off 3.4% in Thursday action and has seen some pressure in other recent sessions.\n\nWedbush's Bryson said that GTC has the potential to bring \"predominantly positive news\" that could serve as \"a near-term positive catalyst in addition to continued inputs suggesting end demand for NVDA's AI products remains robust.\"\n\nRead: Nvidia is no longer Wall Street's favorite stock. This company is.\n\nBut Mizuho desk-based analyst Jordan Klein wondered last week whether some investors would move to take profits coming out of GTC, which could in turn spark more selling by those watching the hypothetical pullback.\n\n-Emily Bary\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization plunged almost 8% to $2.37 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nFantom Price Bulls Aiming For A Breakout\n\nFantom has been gaining massively, recording a 108% increase in the last 30 days, allowing the bulls to hit the resistance at $0.98. However, this rejection allowed the bears and the bulls to start a struggle, with the price fluctuating within the boundaries of the symmetrical triangle, looking to break out.\n\nFTM is trading well above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which suggests that the breakout may happen to the upside, as the bulls may utilize this indicator to push the price.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI is trading around the 50-midline level at 49, which suggests that the price is trading in equilibrium as it prepares for a breakout.\n\nMoreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also bullish as the moving average line (blue) crosses above the signal line, which represents a bullish crossover. Investors often use a bullish crossover as a signal to add to their buys, which may suggest that the looming breakout may be to the upside.\n\nThe green bars on the histogram also extend over the neutral line, which indicates that FTM is currently on a positive momentum.\n\nFantom Price Prediction\n\nThe Fantom price analysis shows that FTM is currently in equilibrium as it tries to break over the upper boundary of the symmetrical triangle. Both the RSI and MACD support this sentiment, as it calls for more buys from investors.\n\nFTM bulls are aiming to breach the $0.98 resistance as they target $1.2.\n\nHowever, the RSI is currently moving to the south towards the oversold region. This may indicate that the price may also break the lower boundary. If this happens, the bears may take control of the price, driving it through a retrace to the support zone around $0.7244.\n\nMeanwhile, as the bulls aim for a trend reversal, investors looking to diversify their portfolio may want to consider 5thScape, a new presale that is attracting significant market interest.\n\n5thScape: Revolutionizing The VR And AR Landscape, 365% Gains\n\nThe 5thScape (5SCAPE) project aims to develop the first AR and VR crypto ecosystem that connects the brightest minds.

America.\n\nThe bank increased its Nvidia price target to $1,100 ahead of its \"AI Woodstock\" event, implying 24% upside.\n\nBofA said Nvidia is trading at a lower forward P/E ratio than it was in November 2022.\n\nEven at a $2.2 trillion valuation, Nvidia stock still isn't expensive, Bank of America said in a note on Wednesday.\n\nThe bank reiterated its \"Buy\" rating and increased its price target to $1,100 from $925, representing potential upside of 24% from current levels.\n\n\"Despite YTD outperformance, NVDA valuation and ownership attractive compared to semis/infotech peers,\" Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said.\n\nShares of Nvidia have surged 80% year-to-date and are up 287% over the past year as demand for its AI-enabling graphic cards remains insatiable.\n\nBut amid the stunning success of Nvidia's underlying business, the company's stock is still trading at valuations lower than when ChatGPT was first launched in 2022.\n\n\"NVDA trading lower today at 37x NTM PE vs. 44x PE when ChatGPT was launched in November 2022,\" Arya said, adding that the stock is trading well within its historical forward price-to-earnings range of 26x to 69x.\n\nMeanwhile, while most investors own Nvidia stock, they're still underweight the stock relative to its weight in the S&P 500.\n\n\"Valuation, ownership levels still suggest room for upside,\" Arya said. \"Our recent ownership analysis suggests that while NVDA is broadly owned (67% of funds in our survey), relative weighting (NVDA ownership concentration vs. concentration in SPX) is below large cap infotech peers (1.01x vs. 1.13x peers) despite nearly 9x faster growth potential,\" Arya said.\n\nFurther upside in Nvidia stock could be sparked by its \"AI Woodstock\" event on March 18, when it hosts its GPU Tech Conference and is set to unveil the successor to its wildly popular H100 chip.\n\n\"We expect GTC to showcase: 1) Rising impact of genAI, omniverse/digital twins across a wide range of end-markets, 2) Opportunity to re-architect nearly $1-$2Tn of global computing infrastructure with accelerators, resulting in a $250-$500bn annual market (vs $250bn prior) over the next 3-5 years, 3) Pipeline update across accelerators (B100, N100), Ethernet switches, DPU, and edge AI,\" Arya said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2396, "text_template":

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

No one expects the Fed to cut its current rate range, which is 5.25% - 5.5%. But investors will pay close attention to guidance about the future, especially during Chair Jay Powell\u2019s press conference. The yield on the 2-Year Treasury Note has risen about 50 basis points since the start of February as markets have de-priced more-aggressive Fed cut scenarios.\n\nAs for the Bank of Japan, it did NOT wait until its next meeting or the one after it to end the \u201cNIRP\u201d era. Instead, it raised its benchmark policy rate to a range of 0% to 0.1% overnight, officially putting \u201cNegative Interest Rate Policy\u201d to bed. The hike was the first one in Japan in 17 years.\n\nThe BOJ also said it would stop buying stock ETFs and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). That wasn\u2019t too surprising considering the Japanese stock market has been on a rampage. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average just hit a record high above 40,000, finally eclipsing its 1989 bubble-era peak.\n\n(Editor's Note: To download the complete MoneyShow 'Top Picks 2024' report, click HERE)\n\nFinally, chipmaker Nvidia Corp.

Stocks have rallied on renewed optimism that the economy is likely to have a softer landing after the Federal Reserve hinted at multiple rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThis saw all three major indexes hitting record highs this year. The Dow and S&P 500 hit all-time highs in early February. Nasdaq was a bit slow in catching up, but on Mar 1, the tech-heavy index hit a new high of 16,274.94 points.\n\nTech stocks particularly performed well last year after a disappointing 2022, helping the broader market, and the rally has continued into this year. The Nasdaq gained 43.4% in 2023, recording one of its best years since 2020. The index has risen 6.7% year to date and is poised to gain in the near term.\n\nThis year\u2019s rally is being particularly fueled by the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, led by NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nExperts believe AI has tremendous potential, which is yet to be witnessed by the world. NVIDIA\u2019s stupendous success over the past year has motivated a large number of tech companies to explore the potential of AI in a bid to secure more business opportunities in the long term.\n\nAlso, the progression of various smart devices is playing a significant role in this field, as they demand computing and learning capabilities for tasks such as face detection, image recognition and video analytics.\n\nThese operations require features such as high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions. These specific requirements are creating favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\n\nBesides, the Federal Reserve has indicated multiple rate cuts this year after ending its monetary tightening campaigns. Market participants are expecting at least five 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.\n\nLower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs, which bode well for growth stocks.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM, which have strong potential for 2024.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 4 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his program on March 12 recalled his obsession with the stock market as a kid and how he became interested in companies and investing when he was just a fourth grader. Cramer advised his viewers to introduce their kids to investing as early as possible. Cramer said you should pick some companies that your kids are familiar with and ask them to guess which one of them would perform the best over time.\n\n\u201cGet them started early\u2026. The stock is a long-term contest. The earlier you get in, the more you can potentially win, over the long haul.\u201d\n\n\"Stocks Still Represent the Greatest Opportunity\"\n\nAnswering a question in the same program, Jim Cramer advised investors not to put \u201ctoo much money\u201d in bonds because Cramer believes \u201cstocks still represent the greatest opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn a separate program on March 15, in which Cramer talked about his career in the Wall Street and how he witnessed some of the biggest market crashes in history, the CNBC host said when you are in your 20s you should invest in growth. Cramer said younger people should take more risk early in life because they have many years ahead of them. Cramer said he \u201creally wants risk taking\u201d when you are younger.\n\nCramer also advised investors not to put all their money in a stock at once. Instead, Cramer recommended that you should invest some in the start and then buy more when the stock is going down.\n\nTalking about some of the worst market crashes in US history, Cramer said:\n\n\u201cTough days don't last forever people but when they come along you need to know how to respond.\u201d\n\nJim Cramer\u2019s Predictions Were Right About These 11 Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nWe cover Jim Cramer's stock picks and recommendations every week.

But what about several others stocks Cramer recommended buying and selling over the past few months? In this article we decided to take a look at the stocks Cramer recommended investors to buy and sell in 2023 or early 2024 and saw how these companies have performed so far in 2024 based on their year-to-date stock performance.\n\nStory continues\n\n9.

In terms of when we can get to adjusted EBITDA breakeven Neutron investment, especially R&D spend, continues to be the pacing item to achieve its critical milestone. Turning to our recent fundraising of $355 million in convertible senior notes. With this financing, we believe we secured a large quantum of cost-effective and shareholder-friendly capital. The roughly $300 million of proceeds, net of our capped call and deal fees, positions the company to exercise inorganic adoptions to further vertically integrate our supply chain with the critical capabilities that are consistent with what we have done successfully in the past, which has enabled larger and more strategic program wins like the recent $0.5 billion SDA program. With that, let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue in the first quarter to range between $92 million and $98 million, representing sequential revenue growth of between 53% and 63%. This range reflects $60 million to $65 million of contribution from space systems and $32 million to $33 million from launch services, which assumes four launches. Although modestly lower than what we previously expected for Q4 just a few months ago. We don\u2019t want to understate how encouraged we are with the magnitude of this forecasted quarter-on-quarter growth and how positively it reflects on the capabilities of the team to deliver this level of growth in such a complex and competitive set of businesses. We expect first quarter GAAP gross margin to range between 24% to 26% and non-GAAP gross margins to range between 29% to 31%.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nArlington, Virginia-based defense contractor AeroVironment, Inc.

The graphics chip giant announced the news during its annual GTC conference in San Jose on Monday.\n\nThe idea is to let developers use Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse tools in an AR/VR setting via the Vision Pro. Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is a platform that allows programmers to create digital twins of objects and locations that they can use to determine how they\u2019ll behave or look in the real world.\n\nNvidia says organizations can use its Omniverse tool to create things like factories in a digital space so that they can understand how workers will move around the facility before they ever put shovels into the ground.\n\nDuring GTC, Nvidia showed how a designer could use a car configuration tool via the Vision Pro to manipulate different aspects of a vehicle and then virtually step into it.\n\nThe company says it\u2019s able to do this via its Omniverse Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, and its Graphics Delivery Network that streams directly to the Vision Pro via the cloud.\n\nA customer uses Apple's Vision Pro headset at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan in New York City, Feb. 2, 2024. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\u201cApple Vision Pro is the first untethered device which allows for enterprise customers to realize their work without compromise,\u201d Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of simulation, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to our customers having access to these amazing tools.\u201d\n\nThe move is a win for both Nvidia and Apple. It ensures that Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is available on Apple\u2019s high-end headset and gives Apple\u2019s Vision Pro another enterprise offering.\n\nApple's $3,499 Vision Pro is too pricy for most consumers, but enterprise customers, for the most part, can more easily swallow that kind of price. Plus, bringing Nvidia's Omniverse technology to the headset makes it a far more attractive purchase.\n\nWhether that means Apple will see a meaningful sales jump, however, remains to be seen. If it does, it could provide a powerful business line for the Vision Pro and Apple's bottom line.\n\nSubscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

In his GTC keynote, Huang demonstrated several such robots completing a variety of tasks.\n\nBuilt for Humanoid Robots\n\nJetson Thor was created as a new computing platform capable of performing complex tasks and interacting safely and naturally with people and machines. It has a modular architecture optimized for performance, power and size.\n\nThe SoC includes a next-generation GPU based on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with a transformer engine delivering 800 teraflops of 8-bit floating point AI performance to run multimodal generative AI models like GR00T. With an integrated functional safety processor, a high-performance CPU cluster and 100GB of ethernet bandwidth, it significantly simplifies design and integration efforts.\n\nNVIDIA is building a comprehensive AI platform for leading humanoid robot companies such as 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Fourier Intelligence, Sanctuary AI, Unitree Robotics and XPENG Robotics, among others.\n\n\u201cWe are at an inflection point in history, with human-centric robots like Digit poised to change labor forever. Modern AI will accelerate development, paving the way for robots like Digit to help people in all aspects of daily life,\u201d said Jonathan Hurst, cofounder and chief robot officer at Agility Robotics. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with NVIDIA to invest in the computing, simulation tools, machine learning environments and other necessary infrastructure to enable the dream of robots being a part of daily life.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmbodied AI will not only help address some of humanity\u2019s biggest challenges, but also create innovations which are currently beyond our reach or imagination,\u201d said Geordie Rose, cofounder and CEO of Sanctuary AI. \u201cTechnology this important shouldn\u2019t be built in silos, which is why we prioritize long-term partners like NVIDIA.\u201d\n\nMajor Updates to Isaac Platform\n\nThe Isaac tools that GR00T utilizes are capable of creating new foundation models for any robot embodiment in any environment. Among these tools are Isaac Lab for reinforcement learning, and OSMO, a compute orchestration service.\n\nEmbodied AI models require massive amounts of real and synthetic data. The new Isaac Lab is a GPU-accelerated, lightweight, performance-optimized application built on Isaac Sim specifically for running thousands of parallel simulations for robot learning.\n\nTo scale robot development workloads across heterogeneous compute, OSMO coordinates the data generation, model training and software/hardware-in-the-loop workflows across distributed environments.\n\nNVIDIA also announced Isaac Manipulator and Isaac Perceptor \u2014 a collection of robotics pretrained models, libraries and reference hardware.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3864, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e684a883-8620-4dff-b104-50fb365b1db6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e684a883-8620-4dff-b104-50fb365b1db6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/670.html", "file_name": "670.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9333, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "160adc85-d6c3-4731-b62d-d9d5c2675e43", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/670.html", "file_name": "670.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9333, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "42f1791828370aede13db5709b2e27e53a7785d8e779fb848010674e9270a9f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b699c0f-54bd-426d-b2e2-68e19467c3c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/670.html", "file_name": "670.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9333, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "65197ad90d51fd9f29f0f4d4fa1ed2b8a2fb7ac9fe51c789db715c9ae180c6c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba6eb369-e4c7-4270-ab8b-16099b0d19aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a6cc43bf906332f24916a66c7d2f9dfe4ccc93f81e4f51c34d16eb3d94cda07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "412675e6990ac6b141ca39abd9d6ac6301a5d063d71b18b6b22bc1dbd9352643", "text": "Among these tools are Isaac Lab for reinforcement learning, and OSMO, a compute orchestration service.\n\nEmbodied AI models require massive amounts of real and synthetic data.

The S&P 500 suffered its first back-to-back weekly losses last week, but also hit a record high for the ninth week in a row, Larkin noted.\n\nTo continue the record streak, \"the market will need to like what it sees in the Fed's statement on Wednesday, and get confirmation from [Fed Chair] Jerome Powell that two months of sticky inflation numbers won't derail the Fed's game plan,\" Larkin said.\n\nDoubts are emerging in the short-term interest-rates market. As of Monday afternoon, overnight index swaps contracts were trading at levels that implied a 48.1% chance of a June rate cut, down from 65.3% on March 8.\n\nFed-funds futures have also priced in a lower probability of a June rate cut, but still see prospects of such a move as slightly better than 50-50, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nRead: Stock market to face reality check when Fed updates its interest-rate forecasts\n\nThe Fed is overwhelmingly expected to leave interest rates unchanged when it concludes a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Investors will pay close attention to the so-called dot plot, a graph representing individual policy makers' expectations for interest rates, and part of the Fed's quarterly Summary of Economic Projections.\n\nThe Fed: Is a June rate cut still possible? Fed's Powell will look to keep options open this week.\n\nThe problem is that there has been little progress in bringing down inflation since the dot plot was last updated in December, and that \"is where the danger lies in this week's meeting,\" David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a client note on Monday.\n\nAmong the 19 contributors to the December dot plot, the median forecast was for the fed-funds rate to fall to 4.6% by the end of 2024 and to 3.6% by the end of 2025, down from its current range of 5.25%-5.50%.

The pattern would allow the Fed to embark on its journey of policy normalization at its June meeting - well in advance of the November elections, so that it couldn't be accused of favoring one political party or the other via a late-in-the-day policy switch, he wrote.\n\nBut looking at the December dot plot, it's clear it wouldn't take much to upset the plan, he said, noting that six Fed participants favored exactly three rate cuts in 2024, while eight favored fewer cuts and five wanted more.\n\n\"If just two of the six centrists were to turn slightly more hawkish, the forecast for three rate cuts in 2024 would shrink to two, upsetting this timetable and markets at the same time,\" Kelly said.\n\nBuilder confidence rose for the fourth month in row in March, as home-buyer demand remained strong.

All told, the universe of AI-themed ETFs traded in the United States has soared to $6.88 billion as of the end of February from $2.55 billion a year earlier, Morningstar data showed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still so early in the evolution of this category \u2026 that investors are still sorting through the possibilities,\u201d said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares.\n\nThe exuberance surrounding AI funds echoes previous waves of investor excitement for other technologies viewed as transformative, from dotcom stocks to electric vehicles.\n\nEach wave introduced major new businesses to the economy and generated astonishing wealth for founders like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as well as ordinary investors. At the same time, many of the companies whose shares soared in previous market booms eventually saw their stock prices fizzle, a fate that may await some of the market\u2019s current AI favorites.\n\nFor now, investors are responding with enthusiasm and Nvidia \u2013 whose chips are seen as the gold standard in AI \u2013 continues to grab the spotlight.\n\nThe assets of the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which seeks to deliver twice the daily return of the chipmaker\u2019s shares and is not included in Morningstar\u2019s data on AI-themed funds, doubled to $2 billion earlier this month. Those flows have followed the nearly 80% climb in Nvidia\u2019s shares so far this year, after the company\u2019s shares tripled in 2023.\n\nAt its developer conference on Monday, the company unveiled the Blackwell B200, an AI chip it says is up to 30 times speedier than its previous chip.\n\nSmaller ETFs have also prospered. Assets in the Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF tripled to about $20 million from $7.5 million earlier this month, said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs.\n\nSeven of the 18 diversified AI-related ETFs that Morningstar tracks have launched within the last three years. An eighth was redesigned to target AI more directly.\n\nThe funds have had collective inflows of $2.68 billion in the last 12 months, according to Morningstar. That is almost double the inflows into global real estate ETFs, the company said.\n\nWhether investor excitement about the possibilities of AI is fueling a bubble or just contributing to a strong bull run in stocks is unclear.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 8% year-to-date, fueled in part by rallies in AI beneficiaries such as Nvidia and Microsoft, following a 24% gain last year. The AI fervor has also driven parabolic moves in the shares of other companies, including a more than 250% gain in Super Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 this week.\n\nSome investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves. ETF issuer Global X found that its Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF, which caps Nvidia exposure to 3%, has tripled in size over the last three months.\n\nBy comparison, its Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has more than 20% of its assets invested in the chipmaker, grew by 20%.\n\nOthers are focused on finding new areas that will benefit from AI, said Rene Reyna, head of thematic ETF strategy at Invesco and manager of the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3577, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "febb9d87-d5a1-4104-9c88-e77a48a4b2eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "febb9d87-d5a1-4104-9c88-e77a48a4b2eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/672.html", "file_name": "672.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5020, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6592363e-79f1-4a4b-9271-00bec92f8742", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/672.html", "file_name": "672.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5020, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "fb2c3a7bc884fc5e4d5d7498e4d89dfe4bfd86979e7b7fbd85b03f71b1de61ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "60238e65-c78c-4d7d-aa65-262b16be40c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/672.html", "file_name": "672.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5020, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "54f06a9070f2a28432497277f5448dbc04a444aac1be2c535bbc29026bcd12e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a748b4d7-97dc-404c-9d21-27b9ffc7cb71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d357859812c7035750e45f225be708a7e8c750838fadad1726216e80de801d92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f82cf1613e8dcb7a76a66a177d7dd348256d5ff152440fbe5798234be222f1ac", "text": "Some investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves.

Less obvious beneficiaries included Walmart and Caterpillar. The bank also recommended exploring \u201cless crowded sub-themes\u201d like the integration of AI and smartphones.\n\nETFs are also scrambling to provide offerings for every taste. Robo Global Robotics & Automation ETF supplements its Nvidia exposure with holdings in stocks some expect to benefit from AI technology, like Intuitive Surgical. The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF is focusing on companies it expects to be beneficiaries of generative AI, including Salesforce.com and Marvell Technology.\n\nStill, at least one flavor of AI-themed ETF has failed to win fans. The WisdomTree US AI Enhanced Value ETF, which uses AI to select its portfolio, has seen outflows of $48.26 million in the last 12 months and lags the S&P 500.\n\nOne possible reason the fund and others in its category have underperformed: many of them lack a position in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)", "start_char_idx": 2976, "end_char_idx": 4986, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a748b4d7-97dc-404c-9d21-27b9ffc7cb71": {"__data__": {"id_": "a748b4d7-97dc-404c-9d21-27b9ffc7cb71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/674.html", "file_name": "674.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5279, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d324bbd4-538a-480b-8862-54c265359f7e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/674.html", "file_name": "674.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5279, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "ce92b27776dec3a81cc74452ccf69f5edc75c502d49474eb282c5884af877925", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "febb9d87-d5a1-4104-9c88-e77a48a4b2eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/672.html", "file_name": "672.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5020, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f82cf1613e8dcb7a76a66a177d7dd348256d5ff152440fbe5798234be222f1ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c5ff34e-e3fb-464a-834e-ffde45d9a05a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7395cd392d826a4730bbb0382d63144efe8b21356688b1824eae841a5790566a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d357859812c7035750e45f225be708a7e8c750838fadad1726216e80de801d92", "text": "The aptly named \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of (mostly) technology companies that have generally delivered above-average returns, especially over the past decade. Here is every member of this clique: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Though all have been admirable in delivering outsize returns, one of them, Nvidia, is in a class of its own.\n\nNone of the other Magnificent Seven members even get close to Nvidia's performance in the past 10 years. Yet, I still wouldn't invest in this company.\n\nNVDA Total Return Level Chart\n\nHeed advice from Warren Buffett\n\nWhen shares of companies rise as much as Nvidia's have, one of the first problems investors tend to think of is valuation. It's often the case that these corporations' future success is baked into their stock prices. Their shares will drop if they fail to live up to the market's lofty expectations. That may be the case with Nvidia, but that's not my rationale for staying away.\n\nThere is a simple and straightforward reason I wouldn't invest in Nvidia stock: My knowledge of the company's business is practically nonexistent. Nvidia is the leading player in manufacturing graphic processing units, critical electronic device components. This sounds like a great business model, but that is about the extent of my expertise, or lack thereof, in this area.\n\nSo, while Nvidia looks like a terrific company from an outsider's perspective, considering just how successful it has been over the past decade, I am in no mood to invest. Warren Buffett, the world's greatest investor, once said: \"Investment must be rational; if you can't understand it, don't do it.\"\n\nThere is no shortage of options\n\nFor what it's worth, I would also avoid investing in Tesla for the same reason. Am I missing out on some massive gains as a result? It's hard to say. If I made it a habit to invest in businesses I know nothing about, I might end up with some excellent stocks that have performed splendidly, like Nvidia and Tesla. But this approach would almost certainly result in some terrible investments, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's unclear whether the net effect on my overall returns would be positive. Thankfully, the rest of the Magnificent Seven stocks are all businesses I understand reasonably well. All of them, I think, are worth serious consideration. Let's pick Apple as an example. Though not as impressive as Nvidia's over the past decade, Apple's returns have also been excellent.\n\nFurther, the company has strong growth prospects. The iPhone is no longer the growth driver it used to be, but underestimating Apple's innovative capabilities would be a mistake. After all, the company didn't create cellphones -- it just made better versions of them and made a fortune in the process.\n\nApple's habit of creating a better mousetrap is well established. It now aims to do the same within generative artificial intelligence. Apple is trailing some of its peers in this area, but that has never stopped the company. Then, there is Apple's services segment, with an installed base of more than 2 billion active devices. The company has enough flexibility to monetize its user base in various ways.\n\nThe sky is the limit for Apple despite its recent slowing top-line growth. In my view, the company's shares still look like a buy. I'd say the same about Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. Here's the lesson for investors: Missing out on some potentially amazing companies due to a lack of understanding regarding how they make money is not the end of the world.\n\nThere will always be other exciting stocks on the market whose businesses are much more comprehensible to each investor.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3746, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c5ff34e-e3fb-464a-834e-ffde45d9a05a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c5ff34e-e3fb-464a-834e-ffde45d9a05a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/674.html", "file_name": "674.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5279, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d324bbd4-538a-480b-8862-54c265359f7e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/674.html", "file_name": "674.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5279, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "ce92b27776dec3a81cc74452ccf69f5edc75c502d49474eb282c5884af877925", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a748b4d7-97dc-404c-9d21-27b9ffc7cb71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/674.html", "file_name": "674.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5279, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d357859812c7035750e45f225be708a7e8c750838fadad1726216e80de801d92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e258ef8f-41fd-4230-9e45-f6c65b8320a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "467e096271a5ed9c31bc23deed847524c0002bc2789b8bacc4550990c2f6de1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7395cd392d826a4730bbb0382d63144efe8b21356688b1824eae841a5790566a", "text": "Then, there is Apple's services segment, with an installed base of more than 2 billion active devices.

A semiconductor is a term for various types of computer chips. Officially called semiconductor devices, these computer chips rely on semiconductor materials like silicon and gallium arsenide to process the electrical current that produces the modern world of computing. They come in many shapes, sizes, enhancements and configurations such as diodes, transistors and integrated circuits to more complicated applications like DRAM memory, simple processors and even GPUs. What types of semiconductor companies are there? First, there are the pure chip designers, such as Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm. These companies use sophisticated software to design and test chips. Second, there are the equipment manufacturers that provide the machines necessary to build computer chips. These include ASML and Lam Research. Then, there are foundries that manufacture the chips. These include Taiwan Semiconductor and GlobalFoundries. Last of all are the integrated device manufacturers who design their own chips and additionally manufacture themselves. These include Samsung and Intel. What is Moore\u2019s Law?

It is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every two years. The \u201claw\u201d is named after Gordon Moore, who founded Fairchild Semiconductor and later Intel. The doubling is possible due to the shrinking size of process nodes or parts in the computer chip. In 1971 the advanced commercial manufacturing had reached 10 microns in width. In 1987 semiconductor technology had advanced to 800 nanometers in width. By 1999, this process had moved to 180 nanometers. By 2007, the size had dropped to 32 nanometers, and this fell all the way to 3 nanometers in 2022, which is close to the size of human DNA. How large is the semiconductor industry? In 2022, the global semiconductor industry had revenues just under $600 billion. In total, the industry shipped 1.15 trillion semiconductor units in 2021. The leading nations involved in the semiconductor supply chain are Taiwan, the United States, China, the Netherlands, South Korea, Japan and Israel.\n\nAMD stock forecast\n\nAMD stock reached down to the 50-day Simple Moving Average on Tuesday for the first time in six months. This proves that the pullback was more severe than any others witnessed this year.\n\nThe sell-off will likely continue for a few reasons. First, AMD stock closed below the January 25 range high just below $185. That level held significance after showing up as resistance once again in late February.

The advent of the internet, genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, the rise of China stocks, 3D printing, cannabis, blockchain technology, and the metaverse, are just some of the examples of game-changing growth trends that fueled the fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) from investors.\n\nAt the moment, no next-big-thing innovation exemplifies the FOMO trade quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution\n\nWith AI, software and systems are handling or overseeing tasks that would normally be taken care of by humans. The utilization of machine learning is what allows software and systems to acquire new information and \"learn\" so they can become more effective at their tasks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has presumed utility across almost every sector and industry, which is probably why the analysts at PwC expect AI to increase global gross domestic product by a staggering $15.7 trillion come 2030.\n\nNo company has directly benefited more from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's market cap has catapulted higher by nearly $2 trillion, with the company closing in on Apple, which is currently the second-largest publicly traded company in the U.S.\n\nThe fuel stoking the fire for Nvidia is the company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPU), which are currently the dominant GPUs in high-compute data centers. With demand handily outpacing the supply of A100 and H100 GPUs, Nvidia has enjoyed otherworldly pricing power, which has sent data center sales skyrocketing.\n\nBut if there's anything I've learned after investing on Wall Street for 26 years, it's that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is. Nvidia may be Wall Street's hottest AI stock right now, but there are 10 very good reasons I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.\n\nStory continues\n\n1. There's a high probability of margin cannibalization\n\nTo start with, there's a strong likelihood that Nvidia could cannibalize its own gross margin as it expands production.\n\nA relatively modest increase in cost of revenue last year makes it pretty clear that pricing power, not an increase in production, drove the bulk of Nvidia's data center sales growth. As GPU scarcity wanes -- both through an increase in competition and an expansion of Nvidia's own production -- the company's pricing power should decline. That's a net-negative for the company's gross margin.\n\n2. External competition is picking up\n\nAlthough Nvidia could control 90% or more of AI-accelerated GPU share in 2024, according to analysts at Citigroup, sustaining its share moving forward could prove difficult.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices unveiled its MI300X AI-GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia in June 2023, with the goal of stepping up production in 2024. Meanwhile, Intel debuted its Gaudi3 AI chip last year, which is targeted at displacing Nvidia's H100 chips for generative AI software. As AMD and Intel begin the rollout of competing GPUs, Nvidia's pricing power and market share would be expected to fall.\n\n3. Internal competition is an even bigger problem\n\nWhile it's well-understood that external competition is growing, what might not be as obvious for investors is that Nvidia's top customers are potential competitors, too.\n\nIn no particular order, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet account for approximately 40% of Nvidia's total sales.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3626, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd7149c3-34e2-4080-b157-16bf8e7acf5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd7149c3-34e2-4080-b157-16bf8e7acf5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/684.html", "file_name": "684.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 10660, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e4c8eb0-5d37-4c49-867b-de1431a219a7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/684.html", "file_name": "684.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 10660, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "dba1a50db1cb7a0f5b54ab10a75d597c9905106991e653d1639790ed1e7d43fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a915ba2f-f279-4ca3-9a62-c6d56c91160b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/684.html", "file_name": "684.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 10660, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "881b646d84401abb4ce2864cb3bf77503f6bb4f234b5c294327a6f586eee62a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3206522c-baba-4125-821a-7c8f0cf54d93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "40a084e636e3eb6466270b25130527fb9c2f2876134eb8c507819a1b6288e496", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "15d613c76d58f75282a576130a89229b83cf13ba5cfd47db28efd8fd10e8210f", "text": "Meanwhile, Intel debuted its Gaudi3 AI chip last year, which is targeted at displacing Nvidia's H100 chips for generative AI software.

Internal competition is an even bigger problem\n\nWhile it's well-understood that external competition is growing, what might not be as obvious for investors is that Nvidia's top customers are potential competitors, too.\n\nIn no particular order, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet account for approximately 40% of Nvidia's total sales. Not only are these businesses unlikely to keep up the level of AI-GPU buying based on their recent order history, but all four are developing AI chips of their own. There's a good chance they won't be as reliant on Nvidia come 2025 or 2026.\n\n4. U.S. regulators are restricting shipments to China\n\nA fourth reason I'm not touching Nvidia with a 10-foot pole is because U.S. regulators aren't doing the company any favors.\n\nOn two occasions, regulators have restricted exports of Nvidia's high-powered GPUs to China, the world's No. 2 economy. This includes the toned-down A800 and H800 chips Nvidia specifically designed for China after an initial round of export restrictions. Regulators are likely costing Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\n5. There hasn't been any insider buying in more than three years\n\nOver the past three years, Nvidia insiders have been steadily selling their shares. Keep in mind that there are viable reasons to sell stock that aren't necessarily negative, such as for tax purposes.\n\nBut there's only one reason insiders buy stock: They expect the value of their shares to increase. The last insider purchase at Nvidia occurred in December 2020. If the company's executives won't buy shares of their own stock, it probably means everyday investors shouldn't, either.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n6. Every next-big-thing investment goes through an early stage bubble\n\nOne of the top reasons to keep your distance from Nvidia is that history is undefeated -- at least when it comes to next-big-thing investments. Every top trend/innovation over the past 30 years has worked its way through an initial bubble, without exception.\n\nTo be clear, early stage bubbles don't preclude next-big-thing innovations from succeeding. Even though some dot-com companies collapsed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the internet proved to be a transformative tool for many surviving businesses. AI has the potential to transform the global economy just like the internet did. However, history suggests that investors have, once again, overestimated the adoption rate of a new trend or innovation.\n\n7. Businesses lack a concrete game plan for deploying AI solutions\n\nIn addition to investors having a lengthy track record of incorrectly forecasting the adoption of perceived-to-be game-changing trends, businesses sometimes have terrible track records of game-planning with new innovations.\n\nAs an example, businesses were eager to invest in the metaverse just a few years ago without being able to define the parameters of what \"the metaverse\" would entail. Without these concrete game plans, metaverse investments sank considerably in 2023.\n\nAlthough AI has broad application, most companies lack a concrete blueprint for how it's going to boost their sales and grow profits. It's a scary reality for a megacap stock like Nvidia that's added close to $2 trillion in market cap in a little over 14 months.\n\n8.", "start_char_idx": 3020, "end_char_idx": 6562, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3206522c-baba-4125-821a-7c8f0cf54d93": {"__data__": {"id_": "3206522c-baba-4125-821a-7c8f0cf54d93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/684.html", "file_name": "684.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 10660, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e4c8eb0-5d37-4c49-867b-de1431a219a7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/684.html", "file_name": "684.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 10660, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "dba1a50db1cb7a0f5b54ab10a75d597c9905106991e653d1639790ed1e7d43fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd7149c3-34e2-4080-b157-16bf8e7acf5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/684.html", "file_name": "684.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 10660, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "15d613c76d58f75282a576130a89229b83cf13ba5cfd47db28efd8fd10e8210f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "754e9213-f693-4478-ab0b-af849d414b2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9b7459ed1af6adfb59bb3d3b71ec2b3277e1c1f1ff40f3152e7aa140d1974a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "40a084e636e3eb6466270b25130527fb9c2f2876134eb8c507819a1b6288e496", "text": "As an example, businesses were eager to invest in the metaverse just a few years ago without being able to define the parameters of what \"the metaverse\" would entail.

It's a scary reality for a megacap stock like Nvidia that's added close to $2 trillion in market cap in a little over 14 months.\n\n8. Recession indicators are concerning for a cyclical company with a premium valuation\n\nAn eighth reason I wouldn't touch Nvidia stock with a 10-foot pole is because a growing number of money-based metrics and predictive indicators are suggesting a U.S. recession is coming. At the end of the day, tech stocks like Nvidia are cyclical, and FOMO moves typically require a strong economy.\n\nSome of the most-worrisome recession indicators right now include:\n\nOnly the fifth notable decline in M2 money supply since 1870.\n\nOnly the third drop of at least 2% in commercial bank credit since 1973.\n\nThe largest yield-curve inversion in more than four decades.\n\nOne of the longest consecutive declines in the Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI) since its inception.\n\nNVDA Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\n9. The valuation makes no sense\n\nThe most common objection to owning Nvidia stock is its valuation. Although its growth rate was off the charts in fiscal 2024 (ended in late January), the company's sequential quarterly sales growth has begun to slow. That makes its valuation of nearly 73 times trailing-12-month (TTM) cash flow, as of the closing bell on March 8, 2024, a tough pill to swallow.\n\nHistory also serves as a warning. With the exception of Amazon and Cisco Systems during the dot-com bubble, no market cap-leading business has had a higher TTM price-to-sales ratio than Nvidia.\n\n10. There are far better deals in the AI space\n\nThe 10th and final reason I wouldn't touch artificial intelligence stock Nvidia with a 10-foot pole is because there are an abundance of cheaper (and safer) options to get AI exposure without running the risk of getting clobbered by a possible bursting of the AI bubble.\n\nAs I recently pointed out, companies like Meta Platforms and Baidu are historically inexpensive and protected from significant downside by their cash-cow foundational operating segments. If you absolutely want direct exposure to AI infrastructure, you can get it from the likes of Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprises. Both provide customizable AI servers, but trade at a considerably lower multiple to forward-year earnings and TTM sales than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia has all the hallmarks of being in a bubble.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company's cutting-edge processors are the gold standard for use with AI models, which has supercharged its stock and helped it surge more than 500% since the start of 2023.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst believes there's still much more stock price appreciation to come.\n\nNvidia is profiting from the AI gold rush\n\nAnalysts at Truist Financial raised their price target on Nvidia to $1,177 while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. That represents a potential gain of 33% over the next 12 months or so compared to the stock price when the market closed on Monday. The Truist analyst said investors are underestimating Nvidia's leading position in parallel computing and AI.\n\nThe analyst goes even further, calling Nvidia \"the AI company,\" citing its ongoing investment and its \"culture of innovation\" as strategic advantages.\n\nA strategic advantage for Nvidia\n\nIt's hard to find fault with the analysts' position. When Nvidia reported the results of its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), the company spent a record $2.46 billion on research and development (R&D), capping off a year in which the company spent $8.68 billion on R&D -- also a record.\n\nMuch has been made about the looming competition as rivals scramble to develop a better, faster, more robust AI processor. However, Nvidia has a long track record of staying ahead of the competition, and -- thanks to its ongoing heavy spending on R&D -- that's unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia is currently selling for 74 times trailing 12-month earnings. Wall Street expects Nvidia to generate earnings per share (EPS) of $24.46 in 2025 and $29.82 by 2026. If the analyst's price target is accurate, that would shrink the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 48 next year and 39 the year after, which suggests Nvidia stock is a bargain at its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those reasons and more, Nvidia stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia, meanwhile, has the potential to grow almost nine times faster than those peers, he said.\n\nAnd even with the explosive run higher for Nvidia shares, which are up nearly 300% over a 12-month period, Arya notes that the stock is trading at 37 times forward earnings estimates, meaning that its valuation multiple is lower than the 44-times multiple it traded at in November 2022, when ChatGPT broke onto the scene and catalyzed broad interest in artificial intelligence.\n\nDon't miss: AMD's AI story is 'unfolding fast.' This bull sees a 25%-plus stock gain ahead.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia holds its annual GTC conference next week, and Arya expects that event to shine more light on Nvidia's expansive market opportunity.\n\nFor example, GTC could showcase Nvidia's potential help upgrade computing infrastructure into one that supports accelerated computing. The company already pegs the installed base of data centers at $1 trillion and says that's rapidly transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing. Plus, management forecasts the installed base could double in the next five years.\n\n\"We expect projects to further expand globally,\" Arya wrote, which would help support a total addressable market in the hundreds of billions that won't only rely on spending from Tier-1 cloud providers. He sees multibillion-dollar opportunities from lower-tier webscalers as well as from sovereign nations, as countries push for AI applications that can help with security, climate and other ambitions.\n\nRead: Nvidia's stock could hit $1,200, this bull says. Here's the key to that rally.\n\nGTC is also expected to feature product announcements, including around Nvidia's forthcoming B100 chip.\n\nArya lifted his price objective on Nvidia shares to $1,100 from $925 while keeping a buy rating on the stock. Were Nvidia shares to hit that new level, the chip company's market value would be $2.75 trillion, based on current share counts. That's above where Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently, although a different BofA analyst sees about 30% upside for Apple shares.\n\nArya's increased optimism wasn't enough to fuel Nvidia's stock early in Wednesday's session, as shares were falling about 3%. That comes on the heels of a 7%-plus rally seen in Tuesday trading.\n\n-Emily Bary\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

After starting Duquesne Capital Management in 1981, Druckenmiller's hedge fund never had a down year, a period that included the Black Monday crash, the dot-com bust, and the great financial crisis. Duquesne Capital Management averaged an annual return of 30% from 1986 to 2010, crushing the broad market.\n\nDruckenmiller closed his fund in 2010, but he didn't stop investing. Today, he runs the Duquesne Family Office, which has about $3.4 billion in assets as of its fourth-quarter update. Recently, the famed investor has been an outspoken bull on AI stocks. Like a number of other CEOs and investors, the billionaire sees it as a major innovation, saying last year, \"AI could be as transformative as the internet.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, AI stocks make up a sizable portion of his portfolio. In fact, just three AI stocks account for 40% of his holdings. Let's take a look at those stocks and see if any are worth buying today.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt might not be a surprise to see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) at the top of this list. Nvidia has dominated the AI narrative, and it's been the biggest winner by market cap, up by more than $1.5 trillion since the start of 2023.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Druckenmiller owned 617,494 shares worth roughly $306 million and call options on the stock worth another $242 million. Combined, those holdings make up 16% of his portfolio. Considering that Nvidia has soared since the start of the year, those options could have paid off handsomely for the billionaire investor.\n\nDruckenmiller began buying Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2022, indicating that he jumped on the stock after ChatGPT was launched, which signaled the start of the AI boom. The investor said in the fall that Nvidia stock was in \"nosebleed territory,\" but shares have continued to rally, and his call buying in Q4 indicates he changed his mind on that synopsis, though he did cut his stake in Nvidia stock by 30% in Q4. It's unclear if he's sold any of his Nvidia stock in Q1 so far, but based on its current price, the right move would have been to hold onto it.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nAfter Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) may be the next-best-known AI stock. The tech giant has been a close partner of ChatGPT parent OpenAI, having invested billions into the AI start-up, and that's given it an edge in the new technology. It's incorporated OpenAI features across its products, including Azure, GitHub, Bing, and its Office suite, and it's designed its own ChatGPT-like Copilot to answer questions, improve communications, and guide users.\n\nDruckenmiller isn't a newcomer to Microsoft. He first began buying the stock in 2015, and he added to his stake in Q4, buying 68,860 shares to bring the total to 1.09 million, or $408.4 million. Microsoft is his largest outright stock holding and accounts for 12% of his portfolio.\n\nNotably, in Q4, Druckenmiller dumped his entire stake in Alphabet, Microsoft's rival, indicating a clear preference for Microsoft.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3309, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "390e881c-e9ad-4dc7-81f8-e59f2318f087": {"__data__": {"id_": "390e881c-e9ad-4dc7-81f8-e59f2318f087", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/695.html", "file_name": "695.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6831, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b6cbdea-a89f-4e8e-becf-6517214a7458", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/695.html", "file_name": "695.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6831, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "abd58189195cf75dcaf9be05ab16efd0e0e2afab6cfcdb4f7649d2e8a32f9878", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf68f318-7af5-4219-89c1-5c659e4d2799", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/695.html", "file_name": "695.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6831, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "154090154ee3617e8af9803e90f0a159f26a6feb3e493add322e96828d918d81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "73c44a68-624c-4235-b1be-faae6738ca89", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9f9871c2cb3d59bb5a976551d5174b3c1b23d0447e33d227efdc5b3782dd8bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bf3f543595d73f7b85ea42dcd51a8576ac532a6fc0b859eb92ddbd0ab33252f3", "text": "It's incorporated OpenAI features across its products, including Azure, GitHub, Bing, and its Office suite, and it's designed its own ChatGPT-like Copilot to answer questions, improve communications, and guide users.\n\nDruckenmiller isn't a newcomer to Microsoft.

Microsoft is his largest outright stock holding and accounts for 12% of his portfolio.\n\nNotably, in Q4, Druckenmiller dumped his entire stake in Alphabet, Microsoft's rival, indicating a clear preference for Microsoft. That decision seems to have paid off, as Microsoft is up 10% this year, while Alphabet is down slightly.\n\n3. Coupang\n\nSouth Korean e-commerce leader Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) may not be an AI stock in the traditional sense, but the company is doing things with artificial intelligence that earn it a place in the category.\n\nCoupang uses artificial intelligence in a variety of ways, including robots at its fulfillment center that can carry more than 2,000 pounds and are called autonomously guided vehicles as they direct themselves around the warehouse. They have cut the human workload by about 65%.\n\nCoupang also uses AI to help warehouse workers, giving each employee a personal digital assistant (PDA) that will assign work and optimize routes using AI and machine learning.\n\nDruckenmiller owned 22.9 million shares of Coupang as of the end of the year, adding 2 million shares to his holdings in Q4 to bring the total stake to $371 million, or 11% of his portfolio. He's owned the Korean e-commerce stock since before it went public. It's not fully clear why Druckenmiller is betting on Coupang, but the stock offers appealing growth at a good value right now.\n\nWhich of these AI stocks are buys?\n\nOf these three stocks, I think Nvidia and Microsoft look like solid buys. Yes, the shares have run up considerably over the last year, but these companies are the respective leaders in their segments of AI (Nvidia in hardware and Microsoft in software), and those leadership positions are likely to pay off in the coming years.\n\nCoupang seems promising as well but riskier. The company is delivering solid growth and trades at a reasonable valuation. However, its long-term growth seems to depend on expanding beyond South Korea and into new markets, as it's already heavily penetrated in its home market. That could pay off for the company, especially as \"developing offerings\" delivered 105% revenue growth to $273 million in Q4, but it's a riskier strategy.\n\nOverall, investors are better off sticking with Nvidia and Microsoft here. If you're an AI investor, it makes sense to follow Druckenmiller's comments and moves as the investing landscape develops. The billionaire called the Nvidia rally, and he may have some foresight into where the AI boom goes next.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.\n\nIn this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Block SQ, CrowdStrike CRWD, MGM Resorts International MGM, The Gap GPS and NVIDIA NVDA as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.\n\nWhy Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?\n\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn\u2019t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\n\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company\u2019s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\n\nOn the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies\u2019 financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company\u2019s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\n\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company\u2019s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\n\nHow to Find Stocks that Can Beat?\n\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors\u2019 dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\n\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company\u2019s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.\n\nLast EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.\n\nIn addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.\n\nEarnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.\n\nIn order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:\n\nNext 3\u20135 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock\u2019s long-term growth prospects.\n\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.\n\nA handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only 15.\n\nHere are five out of 15 stocks:\n\nBlock: The Zacks Rank #1 company offers financial and marketing services through its comprehensive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3860, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fa60eae-ef59-470e-9946-0ca9b21a0aa6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fa60eae-ef59-470e-9946-0ca9b21a0aa6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/699.html", "file_name": "699.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6787, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee9e28e5-f078-4486-a627-5aad15555232", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/699.html", "file_name": "699.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6787, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "fe6984227e359948aea8a541b7d8e723c78a062c76d5be6ae5be92ba9e0c3b3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2dff77fb-845d-4f5b-a4dc-2abb1620a856", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/699.html", "file_name": "699.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6787, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "375c710a1ec8cb37f3f810d44b8a5eea7743a3852c4a1a836dbcadb4fb33c403", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f99c27a-be36-4b93-9f16-df0e20a5b541", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d4bd8b7b666bf5f999290133b6679ae0efbad0e473f86cf964fc50533f14a12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a961816efd6a3dea939f5a410af294d5dc3f6c896497170bcc2a1b9e43c6b808", "text": "In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:\n\nNext 3\u20135 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock\u2019s long-term growth prospects.\n\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.\n\nA handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only 15.\n\nHere are five out of 15 stocks:\n\nBlock: The Zacks Rank #1 company offers financial and marketing services through its comprehensive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses.

Loading...\n\nA Congress member bought shares of Nvidia Corporation NVDA just one day before the company reported fourth-quarter financial results.\n\nHere's a look at the trade and how much the position has risen in value.\n\nWhat Happened: Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has generated numerous headlines for her disclosures of trading of Nvidia stock and options thanks to her venture capitalist husband Paul Pelosi.\n\nOther Congress members bought shares of AI leader Nvidia as well. A new trade disclosed by a member of Congress won't raise as many red flags as million-dollar questionable trades made by the Pelosi\u2019s.\n\nU.S. Representative Michael Guest (R-Miss.) disclosed buying $1,000 to $15,000 worth of shares of Nvidia. The disclosure, shared by Congresstrading on Twitter, shows the trade took place on Feb. 20.\n\nThis means the trade happened the day before the fourth quarter earnings from Nvidia. The technology giant reported earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates from analysts. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 265% year-over-year.\n\nNvidia shares are up over 275% in the last year, and the strong fourth-quarter financial results have helped Nvidia shoot past a market capitalization of $2 trillion as one of the most valuable companies worldwide.\n\nHere's a look at how Guest's trade is working out.\n\nRelated Link: 10 Best Stock Traders In Congress In 2023 (Spoiler: Nancy Pelosi Has Reentered The Chat)\n\nNvidia Trade by Congressman Guest: Shares of Nvidia traded between $662.48 and $688.88 on Feb. 20, 2024.\n\nBased on the trading range and the $1,000 to $15,000 purchase amount in the disclosure, we can estimate how many shares of Nvidia were bought.\n\nIf the trade was $1,000, Guest could have bought between 1.45 and 1.51 shares of Nvidia at the time. The $1,000 would be worth a range of $1,318.43 to $1,372.98 today. This marks a gain of 31.8% to 37.3% in less than one month.\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nIf the trade was $15,000, Guest could have bought between 21.77 and 22.64 shares of Nvidia at the time. The $15,000 would be worth a range of $19,794.59 and $20,585.64. This marks a gain of 32.0% to 37.2% in less than one month.\n\nWhile the trade was likely somewhere in the middle of the range, Guest is up anywhere from 31.8% to 37.3% in less than one month.\n\nGuest was previously named as one of the 10 best trading members of Congress in 2022 based on an annual report from UnusualWhales.\n\nNVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares trade at $909.26 versus a 52-week trading range of $233.60 to $974.\n\nRead Next: Pelosi Loves Palo Alto Networks Stock, So Do These Other Top Performing Traders In Congress", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2642, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26152446-57cf-4c88-9d8f-9e02f267f73a": {"__data__": {"id_": "26152446-57cf-4c88-9d8f-9e02f267f73a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/700.html", "file_name": "700.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2155, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03efe1de-df56-4161-a362-92bd687d32b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/700.html", "file_name": "700.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2155, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "7d21d3c0437b0962a1339f80b456d11160d23c2a9d99f0141cd345fc6495f2b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e748e00-a090-4a6f-b8cf-f7a1a4c7bfc6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/70.html", "file_name": "70.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2644, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "b09f5518679d616bc70cca2ee576e350a844f5a55675b1ede6430673acc16cfe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4922d061-c5d5-494d-83e2-2069f7303a72", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab8deaa47c4d8ba7c03add116f38d77989bd74f90ce206f6475014107f8adac4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ef303b7e880d4cfc2bc38d34fad2e10ffe8c4cff6c6c8463e2b2e20585dc21b9", "text": "This page has not been authorized, sponsored, or otherwise approved or endorsed by the companies represented herein.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

You are missing out big time if you are not on the AI ride. Companies and investors are pushing big money into AI and will rule the market in the coming years. While some celebrated stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have become too expensive to touch, others could soar to new highs soon. According to new Bloomberg research, Generative AI can become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. The economy is growing, and it is time to join the AI hype. Here are three overlooked AI stocks that are soaring in the shadows.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia\u2019s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), has had a good start to 2024. AMD stock has been up 147% in the past year and 46% in the present year. There is rising demand for its chips, and some of the biggest tech companies are lining up to get their hands on AMD chips. AMD is one of the best AI stocks to own.\n\nTrading at $202 today, the stock is moving closer to the 52-week high of $227, and it isn\u2019t done yet. AMD stock will keep moving upward over the next few weeks. There are several reasons to put your money in AMD stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt recently launched the MI300 graphics processing units to handle higher AI workloads. If the GPU is a hit, we could see even better numbers in the coming years. Management predicts revenue of $3.5 billion from its chips this year.\n\nFundamentally, AMD is back on track and saw a 6% year-over-year revenue surge in the fourth quarter. It reported an EPS of $0.41 and a revenue of $6.2 billion. The global data center market is huge and AMD is a mature company with a lot of potential to thrive in a competitive environment.\n\nThe growing demand for chips means that Nvidia cannot handle the supply by itself, and customers will have to look for alternative options. This is a massive growth opportunity for AMD, which can hit new highs in the coming months.\n\nStory continues\n\nMizuho Securities has a buy rating for the stock with a price target of $235. If you think Nvidia is too expensive to buy, consider AMD before it becomes too hot to touch.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR)\n\nPalantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) was once known as a highly secretive business that worked for the government. Over the past decade, the company has taken giant strides in the industry and has achieved profitability.\n\nIt reported the first-ever quarter of positive net income in the fourth quarter and saw a significant improvement in numbers. The company has bagged 103 deals in the quarter, and an increase in commercial clients drives the growth.\n\nOne major driving force for the company is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which is used for data analysis and recommending the right business actions and processes. The company\u2019s boot camps for clients have helped convert leads into deals.\n\nIt saw a 32% YOY rise in the commercial business and an 11% rise in government revenue. The customer count was up 35% YOY.

We could also see strong profitability in the following quarters. Trading at $24 today, the stock looks highly overlooked to me and could double your money.\n\nI have repeatedly recommended Palantir, but having proved its worth, it is a strong buy now. Palantir is a safe stock that has been steadily growing and is up 48% year to date. Already successful in the government industry, Palantir is making its mark in the commercial sector.\n\nAfter the AIPCon event last week, Wedbush analysts raised the stock\u2019s price target from $30 to $35 with an Outperform rating.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAn image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nKnown as one of the best e-commerce companies globally, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top AI stocks, and investors aren\u2019t looking at its AI prowess when they look at the company. The company has a diversified business and holds a presence across multiple industries. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a solid revenue generator for the company. It saw a 13% YOY increase in revenue in the fourth quarter.\n\nAWS holds a large market share and has generated billions in revenue from the segment. In the fourth quarter, the AWS revenue was $24.2 billion and $91 billion for the year. It is a strong segment and highly reliable.\n\nAmazon has been using AI for many years and has helped strengthen the cloud platform. Trading at $175 today, the stock looks overlooked to me and has a lot of space for growth. It is up 16% year to date and 89% in the year. The stock is still trading lower than AMD stock. The company has an attractive valuation and is an ideal long-term play.\n\nWhether you look at Amazon as an e-commerce or an AI stock, it is worth adding to your portfolio. AMZN is a Wall Street favorite today with the majority of Buy ratings. AMZN stock could keep soaring higher in the coming months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This elite group of tech companies has strong brands and a growing customer base, and they are very profitable businesses -- everything an investor looks for in a solid investment.\n\nOver the last year, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has returned 51%, beating the Nasdaq Composite's 32% and the S&P 500's 23% return. There's some debate about how long this group will continue to outperform in the near term. On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, most of these stocks trade at big premiums to the average stock in the major indexes.\n\nThe most expensive of the seven is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which currently has a trailing P/E of 77. Despite its high valuation, the company's superior growth and future opportunity could justify more new highs for years to come. Here's why the stock remains a core holding in my portfolio.\n\nNvidia's growth runway\n\nNvidia is benefiting as data centers switch from central processing units (CPUs) to the far more powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Historically, data centers spent about $250 billion per year on infrastructure, but this amount has increased for the first time in many years, which could be just the beginning of a major spending boom.\n\nThe market for Nvidia's products is proving to be much bigger than originally thought a few years ago. Revenue surged 265% year over year to $22 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, significantly outpacing the growth for the other Magnificent Seven companies.\n\nMETA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nNvidia is just scratching the surface of this opportunity. Company executives have talked about $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure that is starting to adopt accelerated computing, which is the use of multiple GPUs running together to handle large data workloads.\n\nHowever, the opportunity could be much bigger. AI is allowing companies to use data in ways that was not possible before, as Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress discussed at the recent Morgan Stanley technology conference.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is why there are new types of data centers emerging called GPU-specialized cloud service providers. It's one reason Nvidia executives believe the actual data center infrastructure market could be worth closer to $2 trillion.\n\nWhy buy the stock?\n\nAI is completely turning traditional computing on its head, which is reflected in the accelerating demand for Nvidia's H100 GPU. It's almost become a bragging right for companies to talk about how many H100s they have purchased. Magnificent Seven member Meta Platforms has said it plans to have 350,000 H100s up and running by the end of the year.\n\nDemand is already outstripping supply for Nvidia's H200 GPU, which is on track to start shipping in the fiscal second quarter. Company guidance calls for revenue to be up 234% year over year in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nOver the long term, analysts expect Nvidia to grow earnings at 35% per year, which is also higher than the other Magnificent Seven.\n\nMETA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nNvidia's leading share in the GPU market should translate to more growth as data centers continue to upgrade components for AI. As this opportunity unfolds, this GPU stock offers long-term upside that could outperform the other Magnificent Seven over the next decade. Relative to expected earnings this year, Nvidia isn't all that expensive, trading at a forward P/E of 37.\n\nNvidia has been the king of GPUs for many years, so it's basically got the right product at the right time to benefit from the AI boom. But what ultimately seals the deal for me is how much cash the business is producing.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3789, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7fbffdb-c874-4eb8-834c-493a266a10d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7fbffdb-c874-4eb8-834c-493a266a10d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/708.html", "file_name": "708.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5563, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "981ed5f8-1c37-4ba0-8d20-d175ed1d14e0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/708.html", "file_name": "708.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5563, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "9fe099773b99b1a59b42d37a29d3c7bbec757f6b4b07707ebc2678220d37b25f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5920d214-819c-4ed8-840d-e2167eb0d94b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/708.html", "file_name": "708.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5563, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f114a416b6e4926276a974022e7dede315477d5aaafa86a98360a4962b7ec8e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "28e6678a-2384-4595-a1f7-25b4d5d03d69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ebf5f784db3ae4273c13a44e2438e3f540640692b4947d026a865802b37b987b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c2003b2ed3d4f18ea4a8cba2bd8599b0146e0a6ae13a6948a88a064a0feb85af", "text": "META EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nNvidia's leading share in the GPU market should translate to more growth as data centers continue to upgrade components for AI.

OCI Supercluster will become significantly faster with new OCI Compute bare metal instances, ultra-low-latency RDMA networking, and high-performance storage. OCI Compute will adopt both the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and the NVIDIA Blackwell B200 Tensor Core GPU.\n\nThe NVIDIA GB200 Grace\u2122 Blackwell Superchip will power a new era of computing. GB200 delivers up to 30X faster real-time large language model (LLM) inference, 25X lower TCO, and requires 25X less energy compared to the previous generation of GPUs, supercharging AI training, data processing, and engineering design and simulation. NVIDIA Blackwell B200 Tensor Core GPUs are designed for the most demanding AI, data analytics, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.\n\nNVIDIA NIM and CUDA-X\u2122 microservices, including NVIDIA NeMo Retriever for retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) inference deployments, will also help OCI customers bring more insight and accuracy to their generative AI copilots and other productivity tools using their own data.\n\nNVIDIA Grace Blackwell Comes to DGX Cloud on OCI\n\nTo meet escalating customer demand for increasingly complex AI models, the companies are adding NVIDIA Grace Blackwell to NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloud on OCI. Customers will be able to access new GB200 NVL72 based instances through this co-engineered supercomputing service designed for energy-efficient training and inference in an era of trillion-parameter LLMs.\n\nThe full DGX Cloud cluster buildout will include more than 20,000 GB200 accelerators and NVIDIA CX8 InfiniBand networking, providing a highly scalable and performant cloud infrastructure. The cluster will consist of 72 Blackwell GPUs NVL72 and 36 Grace CPUs with fifth-generation NVLink\u2122.", "start_char_idx": 3365, "end_char_idx": 7204, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fad94efa-207b-44c9-be49-d697a8da7db3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fad94efa-207b-44c9-be49-d697a8da7db3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/711.html", "file_name": "711.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 11744, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34839a3f-2126-427e-8405-7878756e0d16", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/711.html", "file_name": "711.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 11744, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "422915fa8443c8aa4a3128dc3e1ba1890c9e278344ac6ff9d8aa16735de21578", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1844dc1-34e1-4f7d-9e3d-7b3dda884004", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/711.html", "file_name": "711.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 11744, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "8c5c3b3f6313bcfe7bf191653d4a0953081b35aae05031aa15829b0e6e34c5a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "02a402f4-7729-41ce-ad9d-7177ca645a59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8e37840257e797d281b014c0aaf5645aa56e60b12a01bf616fcd8492c6474b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bc46992bd1220db342d187ebb28436f8d1253b8f799cc01afa55fe509a41c3bf", "text": "Customers will be able to access new GB200 NVL72 based instances through this co-engineered supercomputing service designed for energy-efficient training and inference in an era of trillion-parameter LLMs.\n\nThe full DGX Cloud cluster buildout will include more than 20,000 GB200 accelerators and NVIDIA CX8 InfiniBand networking, providing a highly scalable and performant cloud infrastructure.

Only the small-cap Russell 2000 was down today, -0.60% \u2014 it\u2019s fifth down-day in the past seven trading sessions. The Russell is now less than 1% positive year to date; compare that with the Nasdaq, which is up +9%.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA NVDA CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang has just now take the stage at this year\u2019s GTC conference, delivering the keynote address in his fresh leather motorcycle jacket. Without getting many details of the speech, Huang is describing new partnerships and/or associations with Ansys ANSS, Synopsis SNPS and Cadence Design Systems CDNS; all three A.I. design companies are up in late trading, by +3.4%, +2.2% and +3%, respectively.\n\n\n\nEarlier today, we saw the release of the latest confidence survey from the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) for February, which came in at 51 \u2014 the highest since July and the fourth-straight month higher. The 50 level, as with many industry indices, denotes growth from loss, and this is the first time we\u2019ve been there since last summer. Mortgage rates averaging below 7% once again is likely a big part of homebuilder confidence, with the Northeast currently the strongest region at 59, followed by the West at 50 (the South and Midwest came in at 43 and 41, respectively).\n\n\n\nTomorrow morning we\u2019ll see more housing data, with Housing Starts and Building Permits reports expected before the bell, also for February. Starts are expected to come in well ahead of the previous month\u2019s lackluster 1.33 million to 1.45 million, while permits \u2014 a proxy for future starts \u2014 are expected to rise slightly, from 1.47 million reported a month ago to 1.5 million expected on Tuesday. Again, slightly lower mortgage rates look to be having a positive impact on the housing market, but we\u2019ll wait until the data actually comes in before emphasizing this.\n\n\n\nFinally, Tesla TSLA caught a bid today, +6% in the regular-trading session for its best trading day in more than a month. News that Tesla\u2019s Y series of EVs will see price hikes across the board has given investors a reason to dive back into shares; Tesla stock is also -30% year to date, so there is still a ways to go yet. Tesla reports Q1 deliveries in a couple weeks; currently, analysts expect the company will have delivered just over 2 million EVs for the quarter.\n\n\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

The recent Q4 beat was spectacular and drove NVDA to its all-time highs. Being at the helm of the AI revolution, my bullish stance on NVDA remains. I am confident in its long-term potential for growth, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and its relatively favorable valuation. Hence, I will buy the stock at current levels.\n\nNVDA Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings Yet Again\n\nNow the third largest company in the world, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q4 result on February 21, driven by accelerated computing and generative AI momentum. Adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share handily beat the analysts\u2019 estimates of $4.59 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+486%) than the Fiscal Q4-2023 (ended January 2023) figure of $0.88 per share.\n\nImpressively, Q4 revenue jumped 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $20.5 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 10.6 percentage points to 76.7% from 66.1% a year ago.\n\nImportantly, NVDA\u2019s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, more than trebled year-over-year to $47.5 billion in Fiscal 2024. Q4 revenues for the segment also saw remarkable growth, increasing by 409% year-over-year to $18.4 billion.\n\nAs expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that China represented only a mid-single-digit percentage of Data Center revenue in Q4 versus 20-25% on an average basis over the last few quarters.\n\nLooking ahead, the Q1 guidance appears promising, with revenues expected to hover around $24 billion. Adjusted gross margins are forecasted to be around 77%.\n\nExuberating great optimism for the future, CEO Jensen Huang commented during the call, \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing\u2026 [and] a second industry-wide transition called generative AI.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA\u2019s Long-Term Trajectory Remains Impressive\n\nNVDA is Wall Street\u2019s favorite for a good reason. Over the last six years, Nvidia\u2019s revenues have skyrocketed by nearly 9x, from $6.91 billion in FY2017 to $60.9 billion in FY2024 (see below). What\u2019s even more applaudable is that its earnings have grown by 18x from $1.67 billion to $29.8 billion over the same period, thanks to its rising profit margins. This data instills in me a profound sense of confidence in NVDA\u2019s strong business fundamentals and its anticipated growth trajectory, driven by AI.\n\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, NVDA is projected to achieve a net profit of $64.3 billion in Fiscal 2025, doubling from the $32.3 billion reported in the recently concluded Fiscal 2024. Furthermore, revenues are expected to surpass the monumental $100 billion milestone.

These remarkable growth expectations provide compelling reasons to continue investing in this AI giant, especially considering that the growth narrative of disruptive generative AI is only just beginning.\n\nNVDA Could Likely Go for a Stock Split\n\nInching closer to the $1,000 milestone price mark, many Wall Street analysts opine that a stock split could occur in the next year or so. NVDA underwent a 4:1 stock split in May 2021, when it was priced at approximately $600. This move facilitated easier access for smaller retail investors to purchase the stock. While a stock split doesn\u2019t inherently alter the company\u2019s valuation or fundamentals, it does broaden its investor base by attracting smaller investors.\n\nOther prominent companies that have opted for stock splits include EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (in 2020 and 2022) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, it is likely that NVDA may consider another stock split in the near future.\n\nNVDA Valuation Still Isn\u2019t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Prowess\n\nHaving overtaken Amazon by market capitalization and on the verge of eclipsing Apple\u2019s market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\n\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive at all. Currently, it\u2019s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 36.9x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, U.S.-based semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a forward P/E of 53.4x.\n\nFurthermore, its current valuation reflects a discount from its five-year average of 46x. These are attractive discount levels and likely present a great buying opportunity, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan NVDA.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 39 Buys and two Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the average Nvidia stock target price of $909.49 suggests that the shares will return 3.4% over the next year.\n\nInterestingly, the average target price has been increasing incredibly as analysts strive to match NVDA\u2019s continuous record-breaking highs month after month. It has increased from $661 just three months ago to $909.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying NVDA for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nNVDA stock is poised to soar to unprecedented heights, propelled by the extraordinary growth expectations within the AI space. As an industry frontrunner, NVDA maintains a substantial lead over its competitors, boasting an almost monopolistic position with an approximately 80% market share in AI chips. This dominant position ensures a robust moat and solidifies its grip on the flourishing AI landscape.", "start_char_idx": 2558, "end_char_idx": 5916, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daf88da6-3b08-4b8a-8cb7-808202498455": {"__data__": {"id_": "daf88da6-3b08-4b8a-8cb7-808202498455", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/72.html", "file_name": "72.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6457, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a88e6aa3-1ba0-4de7-b135-9a060e9ed032", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/72.html", "file_name": "72.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6457, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "cd5a84bf33f514017e1b2a525f86c4bb414e958752484e5bde9966a58f8b941b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6daa62a4-0d65-48df-a6a3-d8d15c35ee84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/72.html", "file_name": "72.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6457, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "8dc31f0830442dadffeb545bd663176b40ea212a5607c875143542db949a5843", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3fa784cf-0b15-47f2-8dbb-7dd7d4dce207", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ddece18a7ff47206d944d5848269b51de417e1037950acf799b633150050978", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "71d63da279f833109bc7744ab3a84c133bd5338c2bdeafbb8206e65a01d72c68", "text": "Interestingly, the average target price has been increasing incredibly as analysts strive to match NVDA\u2019s continuous record-breaking highs month after month.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Loading...\n\nAndrej Karpathy, former director of AI at EV giant Tesla Inc TSLA, said on Sunday that a few Tesla employees might be on a yacht right now, thanks to their stock grants, like Nvidia Corp NVDA employees.\n\nWhat Happened: Karpathy said that the company has had \u201cvery few\u201d true believers of the company working there and taking all employee stock options over a decade. These people did not sell the stock immediately and could now be on a yacht, Karpathy said, while adding that most of these long-term holders, however, are likely awaiting for Tesla to achieve fully autonomous driving with its FSD software before they sell at a premium.\n\nHowever, many employees do sell, Karpathy acknowledged. \u201cMost people don't HODL\u2026,\u201d Karpathy said. He was responding to Openfounder co-founder JD Ross who reminisced about his roommate who went on to join Nvidia after graduating in 2013. \u201cI wonder which yacht he lives on now,\u201d Ross wrote.\n\nNvidia Vs. Tesla Growth: Both Nvidia and Tesla provide their employees with stock grants. While Nvidia shares have risen about 1879% over the past five years and over 100,000% since listing in 1999, Tesla shares have jumped 12,679% since listing in 2010. Compared to Nvidia, Tesla\u2019s is a significantly smaller jump. However, Tesla has also had fewer years on the exchange as a listed, public company.\n\nLoading...

He attributed it as among the reasons for the company not having witnessed unionization thus far.\n\nHowever, in December, Bloomberg reported that the EV giant did not offer any merit-based equity awards in 2023 to some of its salaried employees. Tesla employees usually get merit-based stock grants in addition to their existing equity during performance reviews. Whether this is a long-term shift in Tesla\u2019s compensation plan is unknown, the report said.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Shutterstock.com\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead More: Morgan Stanley Analyst Increasingly Bullish On Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Optimus Venture As Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, Microsoft Pour $675M In FigureAI", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2273, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6dd22938-282e-448c-90d7-b36cf75bb15d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6dd22938-282e-448c-90d7-b36cf75bb15d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/731.html", "file_name": "731.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 15081, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ef3e9de-6464-4a22-8cb3-aa85bc2cbdf9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/731.html", "file_name": "731.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 15081, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "2367eb0131af417c984016eded01d7e9133f189df5cc722126e339c37973e637", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40c84a51-4d62-4712-bc96-7a97195af320", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/73.html", "file_name": "73.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2295, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f99ce1aad34111b084e6a718e4507915720e4ab44030133f246eb6836831abde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "94377f81-43d9-4c04-9204-87394679651c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63e7d5d232e126353472120c51bc8770b171b907c210d7551612841d9a8780fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2aac52a223b909fd2d0b0003a1f6f1a2564779ce141e27834d422aaa79510696", "text": "Loading...

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nTech: A High-Growth Sector\n\nIf you're looking for high growth stocks to invest in, the tech sector is one of the best places to start. Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be exceptional additions to any growth portfolios as this revolutionary technology continues to expand and grow to bigger heights than ever seen before. However, the fact that AI is an exciting place to invest in right now does not automatically mean that every AI stock in the market is a good growth pick for investors. Resultantly, it's important to ensure that investors carefully pick out the AI stocks that can actually deliver on their promises of growth instead of the ones that can't.\n\nOn March 15, Eric Lynch, the Portfolio Manager at Scharf Investments, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss this dilemma in the AI space where investors may not know which businesses can actually grow their earnings. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"We're at a kind of 'where's the beef?' moment for AI, where all the promises need to be delivered this year. If you look at investors' reactions to several AI stories in the past week, you know Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Oracle, and most recently with Adobe yesterday, what you're seeing is a reaction to slower growth than expected.\"\n\nWinners in Artificial Intelligence in 2024\n\nAccording to Lynch, many AI companies today are lagging behind on their promises and cannot perform on par with the expectations leveled at them. As a result, it is becoming ever more important to separate the winners from the losers in this space. Lynch noted the following on which companies he sees as winners in AI:\n\n\"Obviously the chipmakers and the hyperscalers, we've seen that in the stock prices, NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, and most recently, Oracle. Oracle is really guiding for 50% infrastructure cloud growth going forward, because its use case was really generative AI, that it needed for its superior tech stack. So, these names are really benefitting.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThese \"winning\" AI stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are also among the top high growth stocks in the tech and AI sector today and have exciting developments brewing in 2024. For instance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its GTC Conference coming soon this March, where CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote on what to expect from the company this year. Stifel's equity research analyst, Ruben Roy, joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on March 15 to discuss what to expect from the keynote. Here's what he said:\n\n\"I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion on the product roadmap - NVIDIA has increased the cadence at which they bring new products to the market, I think that's really interesting. I think there's gonna be a discussion around the ecosystem that's building around their AI offerings, so it's not just about hardware, right, we're not considering NVIDIA just a chip company anymore. It's a systems company, a software company, it's a networking company. And so I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion, again, around this concept of an AI ecosystem that NVIDIA has been busy building.\"\n\nInvestors interested in artificial intelligence stocks should thus keep their eyes on the upcoming GTC conference, which is expected to bring together tech professionals for stimulating discussions on the future of AI and its impact on the world.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3676, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3f1fb47-6758-454b-ac76-95ab7c6f2852": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3f1fb47-6758-454b-ac76-95ab7c6f2852", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/744.html", "file_name": "744.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 11951, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4a62e90-0a90-4d79-bd14-0f2df38ec7e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/744.html", "file_name": "744.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 11951, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "991c7503f3ce90e3aa13c13671ef04265bb76fb4ac0459c367339c527440b224", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3734eb7b-80d8-4111-a8eb-3c08359eb201", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/744.html", "file_name": "744.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 11951, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "ad0067b13837f84282efeaec3aa0ca446c93eff2b8510b0215a20807ec385b68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b77ab7de-7717-4158-af32-a5ed9af0e6b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f0934692c6eb2015142531795dfa6a6f78f2b587bbb19231c1c56f266c947d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ce1d74a3662c0b2de97828da400b5b076e3e138b75d178d3d9a73105b1265d9d", "text": "I think there's gonna be a discussion around the ecosystem that's building around their AI offerings, so it's not just about hardware, right, we're not considering NVIDIA just a chip company anymore.

It noted that \"Long Magnificent Seven\" is currently the most-crowded trade.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), whose stock has surged 79% this year, on Monday unveiled its plan for the next generation AI microchip. OpenAI investor Microsoft (MSFT) has gained 11% this year and surged 52% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nMoney managers' opinions were more similar on macroeconomics, with 84% of those surveyed saying they expect interest rates will start to fall over the next year, and two-thirds saying they believe a recession is \"unlikely\" in the next 12 months.\n\nInstead, 62% of those polled said they expect a \"soft landing,\" in which central banks hike interest just enough to stop inflation but not enough to bring about a recession. Just 11% said they expect a \"hard landing,\" down from 30% in October 2023.\n\nThe remaining 23% expect a \"no landing\" situation - in which the economy continues to overheat, while both inflation and growth beat expectations. This marks a significant increase in those investors expecting a \"no landing\" situation, up from rates of just 5% in October 2023.\n\nThe situation has seen fund managers take on the most bullish stance seen since January 2022, before the start of the Ukraine war, as those surveyed said they now expect strong economic growth and an increase in the S&P 500 SPX.\n\nInvestors now want companies to start returning cash to shareholders at higher rates than at any previous time since July 2015, with 25% of those surveyed calling for more shareholder returns via share buybacks, dividends, and M&A deals.\n\nIn terms of risks, the U.S. commercial real estate market was seen as being the most likely source of a credit event, with 42% pointing to it as the highest risk. A further 20% pointed to the U.S. shadow banking sector, while 14% pointed to China's property market.\n\nAs for potential economic shocks, higher inflation was pointed to as the top tail risk, with 32% of money managers naming it, versus 21% for geopolitics, 16% for an economic hard landing, 14% for the U.S. elections, 11% for a systemic credit event, and 3% for a Chinese bank crisis.\n\n-Louis Goss\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Markets bounce : Stocks kicked off the new trading week on a higher note, driven by strength in the mega-cap tech stocks ahead of Nvidia 's GTC conference and reports that Apple may partner up with Alphabet to bring the Gemini AI model to the iPhone. The report is easing concerns about Gemini's credibility and sending Alphabet shares to their highest levels since early February. Disney gets a win : A major proxy advisor weighed in on the Disney -Trian board battle. Glass Lewis said Monday it recommends Disney shareholders vote for the company's director nominees and not the slate forth by Trian's Nelson Peltz. Disney's annual meeting is April 3. Although the Glass Lewis decision is a potential setback to Trian's chances of getting enough votes to put Peltz and former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo on the board, Jim Cramer still sees the merits of this contest. \"Disney's board is dysfunctional but the stock's going higher because of the activist pressure. The pressure is good. Nelson was valued as a board member at Procter & Gamble , Mondelez , and Heinz . I don't get the aversion. But the stock is going higher.\" The comeback kids: GE Healthcare climbed back above $90 per share and has put together two positive sessions in a row. It's a good sign considering the stock fell roughly 3.6% last Wednesday to $88.48 after General Electric announced a sale of 14 million shares through a second offering. \"GE Healthcare almost digested the GE block. The company works closely with Nvidia on AI. Nvidia mentions the company in its health-care work,\" Jim said. Shares may also be getting a boost from signs that China has provided stimulus for hospital and teaching equipment. Analysts at Evercore ISI wrote about this last Friday, noting it should also provide a lift to life science tools companies like Club name Danaher . Another recovery in the making is DuPont , which needs to get to $74.69 to fully recover all its losses tied to an awful preannouncement in January. The company's management team recently spoke at a few investor conferences, noting that orders have picked up to the low double digits from 8% when they reported. That order growth provides visibility into a quarter that will be the bottom for its Water & Protection business. But Electronics is the best part of the company's growth story and perhaps this recent comeback is also about the strength it is seeing there. Jim said, \"DuPont must be seeing green shoots in cellphone. Maybe Samsung.\" Keep in mind, DuPont also has exposure to more advanced chips, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing being one of its key customers. Quick hits : \"Worries about GLP-1 usage impacting beverage and snacks group may be receding with the PepsiCo upgrade. It's a good sign for those who are worried about Constellation Brands , which has been a real horse lately,\" Jim said. Citi opened a \"positive catalyst watch\" on Constellation Brands last Wednesday. Separately, Jim said, \"I am looking at Cloudflare . They hired Stephanie Cohen, who is brilliant, from Goldman Sachs .\" Cohen has reportedly left the investment bank to become Cloudfare's chief strategy officer. Up next: The focus at 4 p.m. ET will be on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. That's when he's expected to take the stage at the AI chip giant's annual GTC developers conference. While there's plenty of anticipation around Jensen's upcoming keynote, Jim said, \"There are better days to buy Nvidia than around GTC.

They delivered an average return of 112% last year, led by Nvidia, which gained a whopping 239%.\n\nNvidia continues to lead the group higher in 2024, but shares of electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are heading in the opposite direction:\n\nNVDA Total Return Level Chart\n\nTesla stock is now trading 57% below its all-time high. The company is suffering from a slowdown in electric vehicle sales -- where it generates most of its revenue -- which is forcing investors to adjust their growth expectations for the future.\n\nBut the head of Ark Investment Management, Cathie Wood, thinks Tesla is more than an EV company. She says it's the biggest opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) space thanks to its industry-leading autonomous self-driving software, and it could propel the company to an astronomical valuation in the future.\n\nArk's price target for Tesla stock implies a 1,140% upside over the next three years, but is that realistic?\n\nTesla faced challenges in 2023, but 2024 could be worse\n\nTesla delivered a record 1.8 million EVs in 2023, and its Model Y became the best-selling car in the world. However, with consumers struggling under the pressure of elevated inflation and rising interest rates, the company slashed the price of its EVs by an average of 25.1% throughout last year to spur demand.\n\nGiven the uncertain economic climate, Tesla chose not to issue a sales forecast for 2024. Investors don't like uncertainty, and the lack of guidance is a key reason Tesla stock is down in the early stages of 2024. Some analysts believe the company will deliver around 2.2 million cars this year, representing 22% growth compared to 2023. That's less than half the long-term annual growth target of 50% consistently forecasted by CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThere is some concern that demand for EVs is fading across the industry. Late last year, Ford postponed $12 billion worth of investments in its EV operations, citing weak demand. General Motors scrapped a $5 billion deal with Honda to produce an affordable EV model, and the company abandoned its long-standing production forecast for 2024. EV start-up Rivian Automotive issued a very weak production forecast for 2024 while announcing plans to cut 10% of its workforce in February.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its conference call with investors for the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla offered investors some details about an affordable EV model it plans to produce starting in 2025. It will feature an entry-level price point of around $25,000 to entice consumers at the lower end of the income spectrum, who would otherwise choose a gas-powered car. It could be an important growth driver for Tesla, but it won't solve the company's short-term woes.\n\nImage source: Tesla.\n\nSlowing sales and falling prices sent Tesla's earnings plunging in 2023\n\nTesla's revenue came in at a record-high $96.7 billion in 2023, which marked an increase of 19% compared to 2022. Revenue grew much slower than Tesla's vehicle deliveries, largely because of the price cuts I mentioned.\n\nBut those price cuts had an even greater impact on the company's profitability. Taking in less revenue per EV sale led Tesla's gross profit margin to decline to 18.2% in 2023, from 25.6% in 2022. As a result, its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share fell 23% to $3.12.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3413, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "312c88e9-f3c9-4c93-992b-7c18ebaf21c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "312c88e9-f3c9-4c93-992b-7c18ebaf21c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/759.html", "file_name": "759.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8052, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c294a6d9-ecb9-43de-8d16-948f767578a4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/759.html", "file_name": "759.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8052, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f6bf4d6eddcd047eeb331e52655c4db5bbb2fca9ca5e4bf2aa4b6fbaa43fd1f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "856e89cf-e4b6-4707-b44a-dd7635e9b965", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/759.html", "file_name": "759.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8052, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "98d0dcb9618acda3c1266b293d65d9759fd8b89edba753cf14a095f6dc28ab72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a307e1c5-4630-4b03-abbe-e1b97a5a2644", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31cd3b6a31e989c82b8112ed312e79a5ccd9c9fa915f6cb1c39dd195e4182f33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4a35858c31bc6ff489b326d8c0957a8b17a211e4e240c38daa0eff8cbe1d42ab", "text": "Revenue grew much slower than Tesla's vehicle deliveries, largely because of the price cuts I mentioned.\n\nBut those price cuts had an even greater impact on the company's profitability.

In 2023, EV sales accounted for 85% of the company's total revenue, but Ark believes that will shrink to 47% by 2027, with 44% of its revenue coming from that new technology.\n\nTesla's self-driving software remains in beta mode, but it completed more than 500 million miles of real-world testing with participating customers. It could eventually transform the company's economics in a number of ways.\n\nFirst, Tesla will earn a subscription fee from each customer who buys the self-driving software. Second, Musk says Tesla might consider licensing it to other carmakers. Software typically carries a high gross profit margin of up to 80%, so those two revenue sources could send the company's earnings skyward once it achieves scale.\n\nFinally, Musk wants to build a self-driving ride-hailing network so Tesla customers can monetize their cars when they aren't using them. It would operate similarly to Uber, with Tesla earning a split of the revenue in exchange for maintaining the network.\n\nInterestingly, Ark's forecast doesn't factor in a revenue contribution from Tesla's new humanoid robot, Optimus. Sales could begin in 2027, and Musk intends to eventually ship millions of units at $20,000 each, so it could be an enormous opportunity. Optimus could, theoretically, replace many human jobs in industries like manufacturing to enable plants to operate around the clock.\n\nCan Tesla stock really surge 1,140% from here?\n\nLet's circle back to Tesla's $3.12 in earnings per share for a moment. Based on that figure and its current stock price, Tesla trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 56.2.\n\nTherefore, despite the 57% plunge in its stock price since late 2021, Tesla is still nearly twice as expensive as its peers in the tech sector, represented by the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.9.\n\nArk's prediction that Tesla stock will jump to $2,000 by 2027 hinges on the company generating $1 trillion in annual revenue by then. In other words, the company's revenue will have to grow more than tenfold from here, or by 80.2% compounded annually.\n\nRemember, Musk himself is only targeting a 50% annual increase in EV deliveries going forward, and the company will likely fall significantly short of that in 2024. Plus, even though self-driving software could eventually transform Tesla's economics for the better, it's still in beta mode, with no firm release date. It's unlikely mainstream adoption will occur at scale by 2027.\n\nThe probability that Tesla stock soars 1,140% to reach $2,000 by 2027 appears low.", "start_char_idx": 3005, "end_char_idx": 6257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a307e1c5-4630-4b03-abbe-e1b97a5a2644": {"__data__": {"id_": "a307e1c5-4630-4b03-abbe-e1b97a5a2644", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/759.html", "file_name": "759.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8052, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c294a6d9-ecb9-43de-8d16-948f767578a4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/759.html", "file_name": "759.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8052, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f6bf4d6eddcd047eeb331e52655c4db5bbb2fca9ca5e4bf2aa4b6fbaa43fd1f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "312c88e9-f3c9-4c93-992b-7c18ebaf21c2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/759.html", "file_name": "759.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8052, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "4a35858c31bc6ff489b326d8c0957a8b17a211e4e240c38daa0eff8cbe1d42ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "211c8e98-58f0-466c-8b01-37e1180ec4b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef303b7e880d4cfc2bc38d34fad2e10ffe8c4cff6c6c8463e2b2e20585dc21b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "31cd3b6a31e989c82b8112ed312e79a5ccd9c9fa915f6cb1c39dd195e4182f33", "text": "In other words, the company's revenue will have to grow more than tenfold from here, or by 80.2% compounded annually.\n\nRemember, Musk himself is only targeting a 50% annual increase in EV deliveries going forward, and the company will likely fall significantly short of that in 2024.

The massive prize pools are a testament to the rapid development of this young industry.\n\nIn 2023, Singapore became the first country to host Olympic Esports Week. In an interview with CNBC in June 2023, Singapore\u2019s minister of state for culture, community, and youth, Alvin Tan, said that they are optimistic about the growth opportunities in the industry. The minister added that the event is a \u201cpathfinder\u201d in terms of revenue generation and revealed that the esports audience has reached over half a billion people. He further commented that South East Asia is the fastest-growing esports region. According to a market analysis report by Research and Markets, the global esports market was valued at around $2.56 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21.9% between 2023 and 2030 and reach $12.5 billion by the end of the forecasted period.\n\nThe expansion of the industry is sustained by a significant increase in broadcasting rights, technological innovations, and an increase in the global gaming audience. Nevertheless, the industry is still new and is in its adjustment period. Since 2022, there has been a decline in investments and sponsorship deals in the industry. On January 23, Reuters cited Newzoo\u2019s report and said that the global gaming market declined by 4.3% in 2022. Nevertheless, it grew 0.6% in 2023 and is expected to grow by 2.8% to $189.3 billion in 2024.\n\nThe industry experienced the most significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has served as a sponsor and hardware supplier for esports events, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made significant contributions with its cutting-edge graphics processing technology.\n\nTencent Holdings Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is another big name in the industry. Its US-based subsidiary, Riot Games, produced League of Legends (LoL), which was the most-viewed esports game in the world in 2023, according to Esports Insider.

The explosion in stock prices and earnings in AI-related names like Nvidia (NVDA) has sparked an AI innovation race. Below, I\u2019ve listed three of the most important AI stories to track:\n\nKlarna\u2019s AI Assistant Yields Incredible Results\n\nKlarna is a fintech company that offers a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, allowing customers to make purchases and pay for them later in installments without interest or fees. Klarna partners with retailers to offer this service at checkout, providing consumers with flexible payment options. Klarna also offers a range of financial products and services, including direct payments, financing, and banking solutions, aiming to simplify the shopping experience and provide greater financial flexibility for consumers worldwide.\n\nIn a February 27th press release Klarna revealed shockingly positive statistics about its OpenAI (and Microsoft (MSFT)) powered AI assistant. Stats included:\n\nThe AI assistant has had 2.3 million conversations, two-thirds of Klarna\u2019s customer service chats\n\nIt is doing the equivalent work of 700 full-time agents\n\nIt is on par with human agents in regard to customer satisfaction score\n\nIt is more accurate in errand resolution, leading to a 25% drop in repeat inquiries\n\nCustomers now resolve their errands in less than 2 mins compared to 11 mins previously\n\nIt\u2019s available in 23 markets, 24/7 and communicates in more than 35 languages\n\nIt\u2019s estimated to drive a $40 million USD in profit improvement to Klarna in 2024\n\n(Source: Klarna.com)\n\nThe enormously positive statistics tell me that AI is already at a point where it can completely disrupt the customer service industry for many companies, increasing customer satisfaction and driving profits. If Klarna can do it, I would expect that other fintech firms such as Affirm Holdings (AFRM), Upstart (UPST), and PayPal (PYPL) will follow suit.\n\nStory continues\n\nSora: Text-to-Video is Around the Corner\n\nSora is a text-to-video AI platform that OpenAI has been teasing. Sora can craft intricate scenarios featuring numerous characters, distinct motion patterns, and precise depictions of both the subject and the surroundings. Beyond its capacity to construct videos based solely on textual directives, the model excels in transforming static images into dynamic videos, animating the contents with meticulous accuracy and attention to detail. Furthermore, it can extend existing videos or seamlessly fill in absent frames, enhancing its versatility and utility in various creative endeavors.\n\nUnlikely Partnership in the Works: Gemini + iPhone\n\nThough OpenAI and its ChatGPT platform dominate the early innings of the AI revolution, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is unlikely to go down without a fight.Today, news broke about an unlikely potential partnership between Apple (AAPL) and Google. The pair of mega-cap tech giants are reportedly in discussions to have Google\u2019s generative AI platform, \u201cGemini,\u201d to power the iPhones AI capabilities. A partnership between Apple and Google would create some formidable competition for OpenAI.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe AI-revolution is in its early innings, but innovation and disruption are increasing dramatically.

Analysts at Bank of America BA believe the technology will add up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nMuch has been made about the technology itself and the value it creates downstream \u2013 it certainly has the potential to revolutionize people's daily lives \u2013 but upstream, the technology is already having a big impact.\n\nHardware\n\nThe most obvious example is Nvidia NVDA. The company creates some of the most powerful and advanced chips on earth that are necessary to power AI servers and has positioned itself as the hottest AI stock, up over 260% since this time last year.\n\nNvidia, its primary manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM; its competition, Advanced Micro Devices AMD; and others involved at the same level of the AI value chain all stand to create a staggering amount of wealth as the technology continues to mature. They are, as the old metaphor goes, selling picks and shovels to the gold miners.\n\nCopper Is Key\n\nFurther upstream still, are the precious metals and critical minerals that enable AI and tech as a whole to function. Although silicon is perhaps the most well-known component of computer chips, copper too plays a crucial role.\n\nThe highly conductive metal is used to connect the semiconducting components within an integrated circuit, like axons in a brain. And equally important, it is used to transmit power to the circuit.\n\nAnd beyond chips, the electrical grid at large relies heavily on copper. It is used in the turbines that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, it is used in the batteries that store that power, and it is used in the wires and transformers that carry that power throughout the entire grid. In short, our modern world would not function as it does without it.\n\nGrowing Demand, Shrinking Supply\n\nAI, EVs, decarbonization, and other macro trends are increasing the need for copper. Global demand is expected to reach 36.6 million metric tons by 2031, according to research by McKinsey & Company. That is up from the current demand of 25 million metric tonnes. What's more, the researchers expect global supply in 2031 to fall short by 6.5 million metric tonnes.\n\nGlobal ability to mine and recycle copper is increasingly falling short. Recently, an agreement was reached by leading Chinese copper smelters to cut production in the country due to shortages in the supply of raw materials.\n\nThis confluence of a steadily increasing demand for copper and a growing supply crunch leads many to see copper \u2013 and those who mine and process it \u2013 as ripe for investment.\n\nAll In One\n\nIvana Delevska, and the team at Spear Invest, believe these trends to be very real. Her flagship fund, Spear Alpha ETF SPRX, is invested in the AI value chain, up and downstream.\n\nThe fund has holdings in companies that utilize AI directly, like ZScaler ZS; to companies that produce the hardware, like Nvidia; all the way upstream to companies that mine and process the copper, like Freeport-McMoRan FCX or Teck Resources TECK.\n\nThese industrial holdings that are very far upstream from the tech itself belie a deep understanding of the big picture and thus far, it seems to be working. SPRX is up roughly 70% since this time last year.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3337, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f467ac80-1993-4e2a-aa16-caecbc69959d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f467ac80-1993-4e2a-aa16-caecbc69959d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/775.html", "file_name": "775.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "098a8337-eb88-4c10-b340-10f18b009905", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/775.html", "file_name": "775.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5b171a1a17d0bb8e09aedba2136a39f77f624cceabd81e8b39380772fe286b5d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "85e858d8-bdcc-4441-83dd-9e5b7ffcb65f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/774.html", "file_name": "774.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3347, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f5c884973567829fecf9de30d984875f0b8fc34066912d4026fdd57c7e2adae5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d01f1cd2-2860-464a-9882-2a50a71aab2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "74dff156fe03ca2f0e47a0cf112f4f17f256b4421d55a2c200deb149daac7a6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "text": "", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d01f1cd2-2860-464a-9882-2a50a71aab2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d01f1cd2-2860-464a-9882-2a50a71aab2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/779.html", "file_name": "779.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 10349, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b04dbac6-7802-4738-a206-94e3d40e3648", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/779.html", "file_name": "779.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 10349, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "14f1a576d35c866e2e0d595e536894f0ddddbc9eeae560e9ca8888ce6eef91db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f467ac80-1993-4e2a-aa16-caecbc69959d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/775.html", "file_name": "775.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa175221-aa7c-4f03-b153-d08fdda8f1a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a41f825ce76810728b43b8d4628f9c3f58c711c36a925746d294609ba14d13b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "74dff156fe03ca2f0e47a0cf112f4f17f256b4421d55a2c200deb149daac7a6b", "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \u2014GTC\u2014NVIDIA today announced that leading companies across the transportation sector have adopted the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor\u2122 centralized car computer to power their next-generation consumer and commercial fleets \u2014 from new energy vehicles and trucks to robotaxis, robobuses and last-mile autonomous delivery vehicles.\n\n\n\nDRIVE Thor is an in-vehicle computing platform architected for generative AI applications, which are becoming paramount within the automotive industry.

performance in afternoon trading on Wednesday.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq is lingering in negative territory and the Dow is hovering positive territory, while the S&P 500 has been bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line.\n\nCurrently, the Dow is up 126.74 points or 0.3 percent at 39,132.23 and the S&P 500 is up 0.80 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 5,176.07, but the Nasdaq is down 47.06 points or 0.3 percent at 16,218.58.\n\nThe pullback by the Nasdaq partly reflects weakness in the tech sector, with AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) slumping by 1.8 percent.\n\nOverall trading activity remains somewhat subdued, however, as a lack of major U.S. economic keeps some traders on the sidelines ahead of the release of several key reports in the coming days.\n\nOn Thursday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its report on producer price inflation in the month of February, which may shed additional light on the outlook for interest rates.\n\nProducer prices are expected to rise by 0.3 percent in February, matching the increase seen in January, while the annual rate of producer price growth is expected to accelerate to 1.1 percent from 0 .9 percent.\n\nReports on weekly jobless claims and retail sales are also due to be released on Thursday, with retail sales expected to rebound in February after slumping in January.\n\nOn Friday, trading may be impacted by reaction to reports on import and export prices, industrial production and consumer sentiment.\n\nThe University of Michigan's preliminary report on consumer sentiment in March may be in focus, as it includes reading on inflation expectations.\n\nSector News\n\nMost of the major sectors continue to show only modest moves on the day, contributing to the lackluster performance by the broader .\n\nEnergy stocks are seeing considerable strength, however, with a sharp increase by the price of crude oil contributing to the strength in the sector.\n\nWith crude for April delivery surging $1.91 to $79.47 a barrel, the NYSE Arca Oil Index is up by 2.7 percent and the Philadelphia Oil Service Index is up by 1.4 percent.\n\nAn increase by the price of gold is also contributing to strength among gold stocks, as reflected by the 2.3 percent jump by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index.\n\nOn the other hand, semiconductor stocks have shown a significant move to the downside, dragging the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down by 2.2 percent.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region ended mixed once again on Wednesday. While China's Shanghai Composite Index fell by 0.4 percent and Japan's Nikkei 225 Index dipped by 0.3 percent, South Korea's Kospi climbed by 0.4 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, European stocks moved mostly higher on the day. The French CAC 40 Index advanced by 0.6 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose by 0.3 percent, although the German DAX Index closed just below the unchanged line.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries are extending the pullback seen over the two previous sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 3.1 basis points at 4.186 percent.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3299, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2a28ebf-82f8-414d-8cf0-f286a8b25eb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2a28ebf-82f8-414d-8cf0-f286a8b25eb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/79.html", "file_name": "79.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58ff47a8-07f0-4ffe-9d5d-ccf88e29d9e6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/79.html", "file_name": "79.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "435d30b606bd94ea3d2b375d5913d70471f5d1ac579c83e6983cbf92e2f24c8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13857b1b-5442-4231-af7b-6fba867b3c6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/788.html", "file_name": "788.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3299, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "30783f67c147a412ffe889e65987d8b94950aa93d5cf62caef5b9b709e0176b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4288add8-8e08-4049-bb81-7f122bf2a9bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e71d509a9c8537cb9875a26dcdce57d0e8a939d36fa452c201cc841c43f511a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "text": "", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4288add8-8e08-4049-bb81-7f122bf2a9bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "4288add8-8e08-4049-bb81-7f122bf2a9bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/790.html", "file_name": "790.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3391, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6c1d3486-ced2-4b25-b2d4-848ecbabb1ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/790.html", "file_name": "790.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3391, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "4d234d74059c9c18b99614ddeef0e263ea41d1d9a6411bd66af61eb5f57a8725", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2a28ebf-82f8-414d-8cf0-f286a8b25eb5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/79.html", "file_name": "79.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 0, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7078356-f770-4c0e-b625-0b40fca46585", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "13e1a5b11b0ecaf96ae030f907c7d66332c28f43681f650acbf916b2062e7ba4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6e71d509a9c8537cb9875a26dcdce57d0e8a939d36fa452c201cc841c43f511a", "text": "Nvidia 's blowout rally is far from over as analysts continue to amp up their bets on the AI darling ahead of its highly anticipated GTC Conference. The event, kicking off Monday and nicknamed \"AI Woodstock\" by Bank of America , will be closely monitored by Wall Street analysts and investors on the hunt for insight into the chip giant's long-term AI vision. Along with future AI plans, Nvidia is expected to announce its next-generation B100 graphics processing unit, and share potential updates on its improved ethernet and networking platforms and future software opportunities. Several major Wall Street shops have already beefed up their price targets on the chipmaker heading into the event, with HSBC and Truist joining the flood on Monday. NVDA 1Y mountain Nvidia share performance over the last year According to FactSet, the current consensus price target on Nvidia implies about 4% upside, with 90% of analysts holding a buy or overweight rating. That's on top of a 77% year-to-date gain and 241% year-over-year rally as AI enthusiasm shows no signs of waning. 34% upside? \"Its leading position in parallel compute & AI is owing less to its chips and more to its culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and massive investment in software, services & models,\" wrote Truist's William Stein in a Monday note. \"We believe the upcoming GTC keynote will reveal broadening & deepening AI leadership.\" Stein boosted the firm's price target to $1,177 from $911 a share, reflecting 34% upside from Friday's close. He cited the company's expanding AI datacenter leadership and called the stock a \"consistent winner\" and \"best investment\" idea. \"We expect NVDA to remain the primary beneficiary of AI in the datacenter, and we also expect it to be an important vendor for AI at the edge, which is the focus of today's deep-dive,\" he aid. HSBC's Frank Lee also upped the ante on Nvidia and hiked his price target to $1,050 from $880 a share, implying about 20% upside from Friday's close. He views the company's long-awaited B100 graphics processing unit, or Blackwell chip, and its GB200 AI platform as critical to the company's growing total addressable market and expanded pricing power. Lee estimates that GB200, which combines GPUs and central processing units, could fetch $60,000 to $70,000 and exceed the price of the standalone B100 GPU platform estimated to range between $30,000 and $35,000. \"Not just defending their position, but on the attack with new GB200 AI roadmap,\" he wrote. \"We are encouraged by Nvidia's AI product roadmap which focuses on moving beyond GPUs and towards owning the entire value chain.\" Wall Street turns more bullish HSBC and Truist may be the latest Wall Street shops to up estimates heading into the GTC Conference, but they are far from the first. Bank of America's Vivek Arya boosted his target to $1,100 last week, citing a strong product pipeline and \"still compelling valuation\" as Nvidia's total addressable market broadens.

Muse adjusted his objective to $1,200. \"We think the major takeaway from the week will be a clear vision to NVIDIA being sold out through 2024, a clear product cycle supporting another growth year in 2025 ... and a vibrant ecosystem ripe to monetize the tremendous opportunities as we approach a tipping point in Generative AI,\" Muse wrote. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3389, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7078356-f770-4c0e-b625-0b40fca46585": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7078356-f770-4c0e-b625-0b40fca46585", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/791.html", "file_name": "791.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6354, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3acdd960-fdb5-48a1-bff5-fca5e686b295", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/791.html", "file_name": "791.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6354, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f4e894c70a6384a5e4cb7f232415c6f9c5bef6300cf055b4305112e4c1968c08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4288add8-8e08-4049-bb81-7f122bf2a9bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/790.html", "file_name": "790.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3391, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "6e71d509a9c8537cb9875a26dcdce57d0e8a939d36fa452c201cc841c43f511a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2094a8b-e560-4657-94d0-3699066f0633", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "08458bd4669bdc22b871d3382fbb134b8c3266333b37755b7e3b3a569dfb0cc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "13e1a5b11b0ecaf96ae030f907c7d66332c28f43681f650acbf916b2062e7ba4", "text": "Loading...

These contracts are the most cost-effective hedge against a potentially violent move lower next month, the team said.\n\nLately, activity in the options market has skewed heavily toward bullish call contracts as traders have chased a rally that has continued for nearly five months without a significant pullback.\n\nThis has helped to suppress the price of bearish options like VIX calls, which typically pay off when markets suddenly fall, since implied volatility tends to rise more quickly when markets are falling.\n\n\u201cWe believe VIX calls would be an attractive hedge in case of a pullback in equities,\u201d the Goldman team said.\n\nA call option represents a bet that the underlying asset or index will rise, while a put option represents the opposite.\n\nOne source of inspiration for the recommendation, according to the team, is a Goldman model that shows a high likelihood that markets could experience a sudden selloff over the next month as traders have become complacent while the main indexes have drifted further into record territory.\n\nThe Goldman team also sees next week\u2019s Nvidia Corp. NVDA investor day and the March meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers as two events that could potentially rattle markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nA steady drumbeat of corporate earnings reports could also help to drag down stocks.\n\nMacro events like economic-data releases could potentially rattle markets as well, including upcoming readings on inflation. An unexpected macro shock could send the VIX as high as 28, the Goldman team said.\n\nReports on consumer and producer prices released earlier this week showed a sharper increase in February than economists had expected. Election-related factors are also a risk.\n\nSeasonal trends showing that volatility typically rises in the spring added to Goldman\u2019s growing sense of trepidation. The VIX has averaged 19 in April over the past 30 years, according to the team, led by John Marshall Goldman\u2019s head of derivatives research. The index stood at 14.19 as of Thursday\u2019s close.\n\n\u201cWe believe 1) [VIX] at a historically low level, 2) [S&P 500] close to its all-time highs, 3) high demand for upside asymmetry, 4) our model estimated upside to [VIX] and 5) upcoming macro/micro catalysts offer a compelling case for investors to own [VIX] calls,\u201d the strategists said.\n\nFor now, U.S. stocks remain near record highs, although some weakness has crept into markets recently, with the major U.S. equity indexes finishing lower last week for the third time in the past four and a half months, according to FactSet data.\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX fell for a second day on Thursday, shedding 14.83 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 5,150.48, the index\u2019s fourth-highest close on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA shed 137.66 points, or 0.35%, to finish Thursday at 38905.66. The Nasdaq Composite COMP fell by 49.24 points, or 0.3%, to 16,128.53.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3525, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bf0b126-3e10-461e-b631-9690e0fa0af2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bf0b126-3e10-461e-b631-9690e0fa0af2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/8.html", "file_name": "8.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4724, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bc2690f6-f3fe-4b39-9da0-4dc9562f299b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/8.html", "file_name": "8.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4724, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a9fadba8281a77191de8e9d5116ffb371e61d3cfdd5af747d10f36ea3e046436", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "12723900-0104-40e6-a69f-3d3e504a7043", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/795.html", "file_name": "795.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3551, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5684adea069bc5a012202030b5f48175f044b4b9f560f5df3d555afed9401d37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0af74b2b-8378-4d2f-8751-323e17074f1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c53672937c1c0c1ea03ace885a9832e0879ffaf0fe90c5674cb073eacc1132d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b3d1df2e2e9c98041e6c1f30e293e4fb221ea9f38bc993d18849b3f32f9d2f59", "text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) Global Technology Conference 2024 (GTC 2024) kicked off on Monday, full of \"sizzle and substance\" (said Bank of America), but also offering \"no big surprises\" (according to Morgan Stanley). Investors who had been hoping for more are selling off Nvidia stock modestly today -- down 2.2% through 11 a.m. ET -- on Tuesday morning. And they're not the only ones selling.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) stock is also down 2.2% today, and Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) off 2.6%. Micron (NASDAQ: MU), which has been bundling its high bandwidth memory chips along with the artificial intelligence (AI) chips that Nvidia is selling, is suffering a 1.5% sell-off, as well.\n\nThere may be two reasons for this.\n\nEverything AI starts with Nvidia\n\nNvidia has turned into the standard bearer and industry leader in AI chips, so let's start there.\n\nAs TheFly.com reports, Nvidia offered up a \"slew of product and partner announcements\" last night and laid out plans for expanding AI's role in services, robotics, and the omniverse (the artist formerly known as the metaverse). What Nvidia didn't do, however -- and what investors apparently were hoping it would do -- is update its assessment of the size of the total addressable market (TAM) for AI chips. That means no new increase in the potential sales of Nvidia chips worldwide -- but also no increase in the TAM for Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, or Micron, either (at least according to Nvidia).\n\nThis is probably the first reason semiconductor stocks are having a bad Tuesday morning. But the second reason may be related.\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona?\n\nIn the cases of Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor, there's a second reason for investors to be concerned. As Nikkei Asia reports today, five suppliers to Intel and TSMC have delayed construction of their own facilities in Arizona, which were intended to support the construction of new semiconductor plants there from Intel and TSMC.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuppliers LCY Chemical, Solvay, Chang Chun Group, KPPC Advanced Chemicals, and Topco Scientific are blaming the high cost of construction, labor, and finding workers to build their plants for the postponements -- as well as Intel and TSMC themselves slow-rolling development of their own Arizona plants. TSMC, for example, has postponed the start of mass production at its Arizona plant from 2024 to 2025.\n\nHow bad is this news for Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Company, and Micron? Taken in conjunction with Nvidia's lack of raising its estimate of AI TAM, it sounds a bit concerning for Intel and TSMC. And at least one of the suppliers -- LCY Chemical -- is also a supplier to Micron and its high bandwidth memory chips.\n\nStill, I wouldn't worry too much about today's semiconductor sell-off. For one thing, a $1 trillion TAM for AI chips is still pretty darn large. And as big as Nvidia is, it still sold less than $61 billion in all sorts of chips last year.\n\nPlus, according to Nikkei, it's faster to build chemical supply plants for chipmakers than for the semiconductor manufacturing plants they service. If demand for AI chips grows as expected, and Intel and TSMC get back on schedule building their Arizona plants, the suppliers could still probably finish their own plants in time to supply them before operations commence.\n\nWhile today's news bears watching in case things get worse, I don't see it posing a huge risk to semiconductor stocks over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3498, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0af74b2b-8378-4d2f-8751-323e17074f1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0af74b2b-8378-4d2f-8751-323e17074f1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/8.html", "file_name": "8.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4724, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bc2690f6-f3fe-4b39-9da0-4dc9562f299b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/8.html", "file_name": "8.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4724, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a9fadba8281a77191de8e9d5116ffb371e61d3cfdd5af747d10f36ea3e046436", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6bf0b126-3e10-461e-b631-9690e0fa0af2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/8.html", "file_name": "8.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4724, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "b3d1df2e2e9c98041e6c1f30e293e4fb221ea9f38bc993d18849b3f32f9d2f59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9317ec78-3276-4976-8d00-17516197bf04", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6022b9520891052b851ef01299aa7fdf58e84addc478f4b2c10e170bf1a15928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c53672937c1c0c1ea03ace885a9832e0879ffaf0fe90c5674cb073eacc1132d6", "text": "For one thing, a $1 trillion TAM for AI chips is still pretty darn large.

Now, she's targeting at least $3.5 billion. Overall, she thinks the AI-GPU market will grow an average of 73% annually to $400 billion through 2027.\n\nMore competition isn't the only challenge Nvidia has to overcome this year.\n\nThe U.S. government isn't keen on next-gen AI chips being sold to Chinese companies that could one day use the technology against it.

He recently calculated an upside price target in the \"$1,134 area.\"\n\nHowever, Kamich is concerned that, in the short term, Nvidia's shares could be flashing a warning.\n\nA technical analyst, Kamich's research is based on price and volume trends. He's used technical analysis to evaluate markets for over 50 years, and his latest review of Nvidia's charts resulted in price levels at which investors may get nervous.\n\n\"Notice the large bearish engulfing pattern last week? Notice the heavy trading volume when prices hit $950 per share? Notice how the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator narrowed in recent sessions, telling us that the \"trend strength\" is weakening?\" asked Kamich.\n\nA bearish engulfing pattern consists of a small bullish candle followed by a bigger bearish candle that \"engulfs\" it. MACD is a momentum indicator.\n\nThose potential chart headwinds prompted Kamich to consider what stock prices could trigger those with short-term mindsets to sell.\n\nUsing a point-and-figure charting approach, he identified $915, $875, and $855 as prices where \"we could see recent buyers of NVDA get anxious.\" This led him to conclude, \"Weakness below $855-$840 could cause further declines.\"\n\nOf course, P&F targets aren't guaranteed, and anything can happen. Nevertheless, with Nvidia trading at about $900, short-term investors may want to keep Kamich's levels in mind.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "start_char_idx": 5980, "end_char_idx": 7800, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2343ff5-8b4e-4c41-a40a-a25de2baa521": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2343ff5-8b4e-4c41-a40a-a25de2baa521", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/800.html", "file_name": "800.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4946, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5d4dc37-cf95-4316-8ac5-ce06c2e5c026", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/800.html", "file_name": "800.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4946, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "fdc234545b1cf585c0080004e09c32be3d937233d4c291ec37c40c40a042635f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a49753b9-446b-4a50-af6e-1d8a4e746bb6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/80.html", "file_name": "80.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7816, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "e231cb4202eb1da901cdb20e7299176bbbbf72e0f406ad7d9ff3bcc66d91c246", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b381ad27-d851-4ac9-82d0-15ab9636b3be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "815968fbb87035fbbd9ef41fc2c0fd09252bba83f95a9089e79402a9fb846793", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "aa042b292c8a92f3e0dda6bfaf4ed7c663e93b68cc0ccf674915a2e0869a3fb8", "text": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are a group of megacap technology companies that have thrived over the past few years and led this new bull market, but it's not been a smooth ride for every member of that group.\n\nTwo key members, iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), are moving in opposite directions so far in 2024. Apple's stock price has fallen 10% since January, while Nvidia's has risen over 80%.\n\nSo, which one of these two stocks is the better buy going forward?\n\nWhy Apple has fallen\n\n2024 hasn't been kind to the personal electronics giant. The iPhone maker has fallen more than 10% since January. Why? It's most likely due to declining growth expectations. Apple's revenue growth has slowed significantly, which analysts expect will trickle down to slower earnings growth.\n\nAdditionally, word out of China is that iPhone sales there are slipping. According to research by Counterpoint, iPhone sales were down 24% year over year in China through the first six weeks of the year, as consumers pass on iPhones for Chinese alternatives.\n\nAAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNow, Apple is still a marvelous company. Investing legend Warren Buffett has called it the best business his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns. Apple makes up over 40% of Berkshire's $363 billion stock portfolio. However, it is understandable that Apple faces questions about its long-term growth. Growing isn't always easy for a massive $2.6 trillion company.\n\nWhy Nvidia has risen\n\nOn the other hand, Nvidia has been growing shockingly fast. The company is benefiting from a surge of investments related to AI. Nvidia's AI chips are today's dominant market leader, with an estimated 80% market share. That's shown up in fascinating financial results that have seen Nvidia's revenue and profits go parabolic, launching the stock higher in the process.\n\nThe big question is whether this is a burst or a prolonged trend. Lisa Su, the CEO of Nvidia's competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, believes the AI chip market will grow to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few years. Considering Nvidia's companywide revenue is still \"just\" $61 billion as the market leader, there's a lot of potential upside if this prediction comes true.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nInvestors might be understandably shy toward a stock that has risen so much so fast. However, the fundamentals have (so far) seemingly justified Nvidia's price action. That doesn't mean there aren't risks. For starters, Nvidia does tons of business with relatively few deep-pocketed customers. Losing any of them could put a big dent in revenue. It remains to be seen if AMD and other chip companies can encroach on Nvidia's market share over the coming years.\n\nBut which is the better buy now?\n\nChoosing between these two investments depends on whether you believe Apple is more likely to rebound or if Nvidia will run out of steam. Looking at fundamentals, Nvidia has a clear advantage. I like using the PEG ratio to gauge how much I pay for a stock's earnings growth. In other words, how much bang for your buck are you getting?\n\nComparing the two stocks below reveals a clear winner:\n\nCompany Forward P/E Ratio Expected Long-Term Average Annual EPS Growth PEG Ratio Apple 26.0 9.4% 2.7 Nvidia 35.6 34.8% 1.0\n\nData source: Ycharts.

This ETF, which is focused on the semiconductor sector, boasts an excellent performance history since 2009, with an annualized return of 22.3%, making this ETF the top performer among the five listed here.\n\nThe fund's top holdings include well-known companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom, but it also holds shares of lesser-known semiconductor stocks like Rambus and Impinj.\n\nCompany Name Symbol Percentage of Assets Nvidia NVDA 4.2% Advanced Micro Devices AMD 3.8% Broadcom AVGO 3.5% Marvell Technology MRVL 3.5% Impinj PI 3.4%\n\nGranted, investors pay a little more for this ETF; its expense ratio is 0.35%, meaning a $10,000 investment generates $35 in fees. However, that ratio is still below the average ETF expense ratio of 0.57%.\n\nFinally, with a scant dividend yield of 0.3%, this isn't a fund for income-seeking investors.\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR ETF\n\nNext up is the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT: XLK).\n\nThis ETF is focused on the tech sector and counts among its top holdings tech giants Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. In addition, other tech stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices, Cisco Systems, and Salesforce, crack its top 10 holdings list.\n\nCompany Name Symbol Percentage of Assets Microsoft MSFT 22.9% Apple AAPL 19.1% Nvidia NVDA 6.7% Broadcom AVGO 5.6% Advanced Micro Devices AMD 3.1%\n\nBecause of its tech-heavy nature, the fund has a modest dividend yield of only 0.7%. Meanwhile, its expense ratio of 0.09% means investors will give up only $9 in fees for every $10,000 invested each year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince 2009, the fund has delivered an excellent 20.4% annualized return.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 Growth ETF\n\nWhat I like about the SPDR S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYG) is the fund's wide array of growth stocks.\n\nSure, it's no big surprise that its top holdings are dominated by \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks like Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon, but beyond that list, the fund has a decent mix of stocks from other sectors. For example, consumer stocks make up 14% of its holdings, while healthcare and industrials make up 7% and 6%, respectively.\n\nCompany Name Symbol Percentage of Assets Microsoft MSFT 13.1% Apple AAPL 11.2% Nvidia NVDA 8.3% Amazon AMZN 6.8% Meta Platforms META 4.6%\n\nBetter yet, investors pay rock-bottom fees.

If you\u2019re considering entering the exciting world of options trading, keep reading to learn about the stocks that are experiencing some of the highest trading volume, as well as to get a better understanding of how options trading works and what you stand to gain and lose.\n\nOnly you can determine the best options trading stocks for your individual investment strategy, but you stand to benefit from understanding why the securities with the highest options volume are as popular as they are.\n\nThese are some of the best options trading stocks:\n\nCompany 90-Day Average Options Volume Segment Tesla (TSLA) 2,264,914 Electric vehicles Nvidia (NVDA) 1,354,137 Semiconductors Apple (AAPL) 938,863 Consumer electronics and software Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 785,276 Semiconductors Amazon.com (AMZN) 579,230 Internet retail Palantir Technologies (PLTR) 429,134 Technology, software and infrastructure Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) 424,621 Finance, capital markets Microsoft (MSFT) 419,230 Technology, software and infrastructure\n\nWhich Stocks Are Best for Options Trading?\n\nThe following stocks have experienced the highest trading volume among options traders over the last 90 days.\n\n1. Tesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla has been trading with high levels of implied volatility. That means that options traders expect major price swings in one direction or the other in the near future. Part of the reason for all of that implied volatility might be due to Elon Musk, its unpredictable and controversial leader, but waning demand for electric vehicles and competition from other manufacturers are primary factors.\n\n2. Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia experienced enormous price swings in 2022, as its primary technology fell in the crosshairs of a trade war with China. January 2023 marked the beginning of an upward trend that accelerated in early 2024. The stock\u2019s 12-month price target is only a few percentage points higher than the current price, and an increasing number of analysts recommend holding the stock, but the stock is still a \u201cstrong buy\u201d \u2014 which suggests analysts are divided on which way share prices will go.\n\n3. Apple (AAPL)\n\nWith a market cap of more than $2.6 trillion, Apple is the second-biggest company in the U.S., behind Microsoft. Traditionally, that level of size and stability makes a company an unlikely candidate for options trading, but its trading volume and volatility keep it on this list.\n\n4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nThe U.S. government has taken steps to prevent AMD from exporting its most advanced and sophisticated chips to China, sparking the kind of wild volatility that options traders love to bet for \u2014 and against.\n\n5. Amazon.com (AMZN)\n\nWhile dwarfed by Apple\u2019s $2.6 trillion market cap, Amazon\u2019s $1.8 trillion cap makes it America\u2019s fourth-largest publicly traded company and the fifth largest worldwide. The stock has bounced back from a steep decline in 2022 but fell precipitously in the second half of last year.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3478, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7df8ba25-a70d-49b8-919f-fd8258e3420f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7df8ba25-a70d-49b8-919f-fd8258e3420f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/802.html", "file_name": "802.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8234, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94576939-74e9-434e-b95c-7cecc02996d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/802.html", "file_name": "802.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8234, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "bd092210ed5271ce0c1ed63540c907b65b63ccb821b45c5c2f2460d985b478a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d8418b3-4525-4679-9804-d199f89060e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/802.html", "file_name": "802.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8234, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "56602d01d59372bb6434f4e878539035d93326937c400f898eba59a5dc5cbd17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1dd37524-0041-4f84-bb26-6e917af6ec09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4b5d6a5b6012df2ca5ed4711b384ecd16de8d408107c224204e7fa749bc4463", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a2507bce711b759857f293cd581608328fc688cfc65319d6bbc3b39afc100b0f", "text": "4.

The stock has bounced back from a steep decline in 2022 but fell precipitously in the second half of last year. It since has bounced back, and most analysts see that trend continuing.\n\n6. Palantir Technologies (PLTR)\n\nPalantir stock is up 37% year to date and 197% over the past year, making it one of the fastest-growing artificial intelligence stocks. Investor interest has surged recently, according to a Zacks Investment Research analysis of search trends on Zacks.com. Some analysts rate the stock a \u201csell,\u201d but investment firms like Wedbush and BofA Securities are optimistic about its near-term performance. It\u2019s no surprise that Palantir\u2019s beta shows that shares are almost three times as volatile as the average stock.\n\n7. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA)\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings is a digital asset technology company focused on bitcoin mining. Recent Securities and Exchange Commission approval of spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 that is, funds that trade directly in bitcoin \u2014 has driven bitcoin trading and pricing to record levels, to the benefit of bitcoin miners. Despite strong earnings and revenue, the speculative nature of cryptocurrency investments has resulted in a whopping 5.4 beta score for volatility, which is a lot of risk for a typical investor but desirable if you\u2019re trading options.\n\n8. Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft, like other tech stocks, has made a strong showing since the start of 2023. It\u2019s up almost 11% year to date and 57% for the past year, and it has a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating from analysts, who predict it\u2019ll rise nearly 10% within the year. With a beta of 0.89, it\u2019s currently less volatile than the overall market, but trading volume is high.\n\nIs Options Trading Better Than Stocks?\n\nOptions are no better or worse than stocks, bonds, mutual funds, futures or cryptocurrency. They\u2019re just another asset class that has a place in many investor portfolios. Because they derive their value from an underlying asset, options are classified as derivatives.\n\nThose underlying assets are typically 100 shares of stock, but options contracts can be written for just about any asset class, including commodities, bonds and currency. Different investors use options for different reasons, like to hedge against market downturns, for income or as a speculative bet made in pursuit of large gains.\n\nCan You Get Rich From Options Trading?\n\nYou can get rich from trading options, but according to Merrill, most options investors use strategies that limit their risk but also limit their potential for gains.\n\nOne of the reasons that options trading is so attractive is because there\u2019s room for profit during times of volatility, no matter which direction the volatility moves.

It also gives them the flexibility to buy or sell the assets in a contract by the contract\u2019s expiration date without obligating them to do so.\n\nHowever, some strategies, like uncovered short calls, expose options traders to the potential for unlimited losses. When you purchase options as a long call, on the other hand, the potential for gains is unlimited, but the maximum loss is limited to the premium paid.\n\nWhich Option Is Best for Day Trading?\n\nAccording to DayTrading.com, options were not typically a part of traditional intraday trading until recently. Now, however, day traders commonly incorporate options trading into their strategies.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that day trading is risky and carries the potential for fast and significant losses \u2014 adding options into the mix only raises the stakes. Before you begin to think about what style of options trading is right for you as a day trader, consider the amplified risk.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, options day trading took off during the pandemic, when people were trapped at home, often out of work and stuck experimenting with ways to make money. The outcome was predictable \u2014 during the bull run that took place after the original COVID-19 crash, day traders lost $1.14 billion trading options.\n\nFinal Take\n\nOptions trading is riskier and more complicated than standard buy-and-hold stock investing \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that everyday retail investors can\u2019t learn how to do it. Learning, however, should come before doing. Conduct as much research as you can and decide on a strategy before you dive into options trading.\n\nOnce you think you\u2019re ready, sign up for a brokerage account that lets you test your strategy with a trading simulator in real time before you put actual money on the line.\n\nDaria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nData is accurate as of March 17, 2024, and is subject to change.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 8 Best Stocks for Trading Options in 2024", "start_char_idx": 5893, "end_char_idx": 8172, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a5216fb-9820-4912-a9ac-92e2ebec9f1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a5216fb-9820-4912-a9ac-92e2ebec9f1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/808.html", "file_name": "808.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2155, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6914073f-f32e-42b6-a705-01fb9ade0c5c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/808.html", "file_name": "808.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2155, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "7646cf108cf0a141663df0c54b40bfde9c691392467c96f7933aaf9b3d849032", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1dd37524-0041-4f84-bb26-6e917af6ec09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/802.html", "file_name": "802.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8234, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a4b5d6a5b6012df2ca5ed4711b384ecd16de8d408107c224204e7fa749bc4463", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "110d218f-c5da-4c5a-bc92-fbd63f6c4458", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6044725c042754489b20c57fa476a23dff6542b4c543484693fa2b6d6e5db945", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ef303b7e880d4cfc2bc38d34fad2e10ffe8c4cff6c6c8463e2b2e20585dc21b9", "text": "This page has not been authorized, sponsored, or otherwise approved or endorsed by the companies represented herein.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.18% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through January 1, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

With the lowered RSI, SOXL has room to surge higher after the consolidation is over but whether or not that happens is dependent on whether the fund\u2019s largest holdings, such as Nvidia Corporation NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc AMD continue to trend higher within their bull cycles.\n\nAMD is weighted at 8.67% within the SOXL fund, while Broadcom, Inc AVGO is weighted at 8.59%. Nvidia is the third largest holding within the ETF, weighted at 7.54%.\n\nRead Next: AI Tailwinds Boost Super Micro Computer Analyst's Bull Case: 'Expect Strong Revenue Growth'\n\nTrending: Elon Musk, Steve Jobs Autographed Business Cards Up For Auction: Here's How Much They Will Set You Back\n\nOn Wednesday, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised a price target from $925 to $1,100. The new price target implies an upside of 21% and indicates Arya sees room for Nvidia to surge higher.\n\nThere are always two sides to every trade, however, and traders who are bearish on the semiconductor sector or who are looking to trade a further pullback can track the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares SOXS.\n\nIt should be noted that Direxion\u2019s leveraged funds are designed for short-term traders and shouldn\u2019t be held for a long period of time.\n\nWant direct analysis?

The bounce up from that area on three separate occasions indicates that there\u2019s strong support at that level, which has also caused the ETF to print a triple bottom pattern there.\n\nOn Wednesday, SOXL was working to form a hammer candlestick on the daily chart, which indicates the local bottom may have occurred. If SOXL trades higher on Thursday, Wednesday\u2019s candlestick will be confirmed and the ETF may rise over Tuesday\u2019s high-of-day, negating its recent downtrend.\n\nIf SOXL breaks up above Tuesday\u2019s high-of-day, the ETF will also break bullishly from a rising channel pattern, which SOXL has been trading in since Dec. 14.\n\nBearish traders want to see SOXL fall under the $45 mark, which will negate the triple bottom pattern and could accelerate downside pressure.\n\nSOXL has resistance above at $50 and at $55.94 and support below at $44.97 and at $41.60.\n\nFeatured image sourced from Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2909, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88a75ec9-e2ca-4628-a442-a903626d5209": {"__data__": {"id_": "88a75ec9-e2ca-4628-a442-a903626d5209", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/829.html", "file_name": "829.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4566, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7346467-e70e-4cf5-86f9-02eb273fa8ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/829.html", "file_name": "829.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4566, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a193ca1c4c87f82c0f559b8f35ae1d84e0e4a52576ed98e2d1e0c449709d1791", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "845f8384-caf7-4af4-bcf3-4a0bc7a09aaa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/826.html", "file_name": "826.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 2925, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "8a02b8dc5302ddcb178444de535486570bc69ba086521605065f871d43bdfc09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "49b9df32-3705-45e5-a7af-9bcd08f1cc16", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "11d94e2bc59a3a285ee2f0d6d167865ec54e9ea7c77426c0f9b6c7446af86e1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8843b22b8e9b1232c6fcfc59bec28c258652be12b1247d53acf08f7d0b3aad66", "text": "Guidewire Software GWRE recently announced that Trygg-Hansa Forsakring had selected Guidewire ClaimCenter on Guidewire Cloud to boost the efficiency of its claim operations.\n\n\n\nTrygg-Hansa is the Swedish branch of Tryg Forsikring A/S, one of the largest providers of non-life insurance services in Scandinavia.

start the week on a firm note, and just below record highs, as investors wait to see if the Federal Reserve on Wednesday shifts its interest rate projections.\n\nHowever, analysts at JPMorgan have become less enamored of U.S. stocks - relative to their European cousins that is.\n\nIn a note published over the weekend, a team led by Mislav Matejka, say they are closing their recommendation to be overweight U.S. stocks versus the eurozone. And they give five reasons why.\n\nFirst, the eurozone has already lagged in the last few quarters, shedding 14% relative to Wall Street since last May, while enduring relatively greater fund outflows in 41 of the past 52 weeks.\n\nThe eurozone is trading on 13.3 times forward earnings compared to the U.S. on 21 times. Indeed, as the chart below shows, the eurozone's price to earnings discount to the U.S. is at its cheapest versus any time before the COVID pandemic.\n\nThe second reason is that growth over value, which had favored the big tech-rich U.S. market, has already performed exceptionally well, says JPMorgan, and is now \"trading stretched and is at risk of a reversal, given MOMO [momentum] concentration.\"\n\n\"Of course, within Europe there is also an increasing risk of MOMO unwind, but the magnitude of the potential impact would always be greater for the U.S. market,\" JPMorgan adds.\n\nNext, as the chart below shows, after a period of underperformance Europe's economic activity momentum is once again moving above the U.S.\n\nThis ties in with a fourth point, which is that activity and stock markets in China is showing signs of improving , which will help the export-sensitive eurozone bourses.\n\nThen there's monetary policy. Typically, the European Central Bank follows the Fed's lead, but it could be different this cycle, supporting eurozone stocks. \"Relative to the peak dovishness point in early January, where the Fed was projected to ease by more than the ECB this year, now the ECB is expected to act more aggressively,\" says JPMorgan.\n\nImportantly, JPMorgan says it is not switching to overweight eurozone versus the U.S. because it believes \"the risk of a broader market drawdown is elevated.\" A U.S. economic slowdown would also hit sentiment in Europe, while concerns about trade protectionism ahead of the U.S. election may also take a toll on investor confidence globally.\n\n\"Given the above, equity markets could have a drawdown over the next months both because of growth disappointments, and also due to continued sticky inflation prints and higher for longer Fed; ie, we might end up with the opposite from Goldilocks,\" says the JPMorgan team.\n\nMarkets\n\nU.S. stock-index futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are higher as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y dip. The dollar DXY is little changed, while oil prices (CL.1) rise and gold (GC00) is trading around $2,154 an ounce.\n\nFor more market updates plus actionable trade ideas for stocks, options and crypto, subscribe to MarketDiem by Investor's Business Daily.\n\nThe buzz\n\nU.S. economic data due on Monday includes the February homebuilder confidence index at 10 a.m. Eastern.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) will start its annual GTC conference Monday, with the highlight likely to be chief executive Jensen Huang's keynote speech, starting at 4 p.m. Eastern.\n\nApple (AAPL) is in talks to build Google's (GOOG) Gemini AI engine into the iPhone, according to a report.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3487, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfcae7cb-35b8-4d85-9d22-7a1d4dc4d7f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfcae7cb-35b8-4d85-9d22-7a1d4dc4d7f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/837.html", "file_name": "837.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5024, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e67069a0-7a4f-4fb0-87d7-d0003166a4fc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/837.html", "file_name": "837.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5024, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "008433c8344879ad381606338a1909768cf09ff2eb4b0a3b58e718da74eb2fee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "acda7607-0604-4639-9f33-81abbb23909b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/837.html", "file_name": "837.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5024, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5b8f5870bd3de1fdabaa773c665c37518044490c5a081de4ba4097334f8e8503", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "24120000-bdd8-48ce-a7b1-3462b17ad5af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f50e59a2a0f051eb17b24a498ced7d2c32768cbe267e00c8ce5d8e55aedc5f41", "text": "For more market updates plus actionable trade ideas for stocks, options and crypto, subscribe to MarketDiem by Investor's Business Daily.\n\nThe buzz\n\nU.S. economic data due on Monday includes the February homebuilder confidence index at 10 a.m. Eastern.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) will start its annual GTC conference Monday, with the highlight likely to be chief executive Jensen Huang's keynote speech, starting at 4 p.m. Eastern.\n\nApple (AAPL) is in talks to build Google's (GOOG) Gemini AI engine into the iPhone, according to a report.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index CN:SHCOMP climbed 1% after Beijing reported that China's industrial output rose an annual 7% over January and February, and retail sales jumped 5.5%.\n\nBest of the web\n\nCATL, the little-known Chinese battery maker that has the U.S. worried.\n\nTrump economic advisers float three names for Fed chair.\n\nA fake Bill Ackman is scamming investors out of millions on Facebook.\n\nThe chart\n\nJulian Emanuel at Evercore ISI notes that broader market momentum has stalled since Nvidia hit a high of $974 on March 8.

This new chip marks a significant leap in computing power and efficiency. The Blackwell GPUs have set a new standard, pushing the boundaries of technology.\n\nTheir importance not only lies in their advanced features but also in their role in enhancing large language models. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the substantial increase in computing power these GPUs offer.\n\nThe scale of this enhancement is evident in the impressive number of transistors they possess. With 208 billion transistors, the Blackwell GPUs more than double the count of last year's H100 model, illustrating Nvidia's rapid technological progress.\n\nWhat distinguishes the Blackwell GPUs is their exceptional performance in AI model training and inference, redefining efficiency. They are twice as effective in model training and have seen a fivefold improvement in inference capabilities compared to their predecessors, demonstrating Nvidia's commitment to delivering both power and precision.\n\nThe company's success in the tech sector is evident through its financial performance, boasting a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion.

It has amassed assets over $1.27 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Large Cap Blend\n\nLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.\n\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\n\nCosts\n\nExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.19%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 33.90% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 8.52% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 38.26% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nIWL seeks to match the performance of the Russell Top 200 Index before fees and expenses. The Russell Top 200 Index is a float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted index that measures the performance of the largest capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF has gained about 8.98% so far this year and was up about 39.24% in the last one year (as of 03/14/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $92.44 and $125.67.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.99 and standard deviation of 17.44% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 201 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nIShares Russell Top 200 ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, IWL is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\n\nThe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $453.80 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $506.54 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.\n\nBottom-Line\n\nRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3317, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fb95259-7f61-480d-9505-5e4519a9f653": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fb95259-7f61-480d-9505-5e4519a9f653", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/840.html", "file_name": "840.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4077, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "813d073c-cca9-44b9-a0a2-aa19d7e146e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/840.html", "file_name": "840.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4077, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "50a8afa0913264f2d6895c35d4bca57ee656848ec45dd1bc1c82f60a639a4a81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba00822f-c60b-4bb0-a8e4-0abdfcf1c245", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/840.html", "file_name": "840.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4077, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "703825238fa20cb501d816c401c2d2e5b2fcb5ad6c320415bf69fdda5d5b83b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d8b1ba5-c4f4-4a32-8145-645a88af76c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d9bc1fa6a4492d94235982e352893fa43fa960ab67cc3086e476b76e451ba1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "843f533fe1b7741a05ffdbd8137ab5e41e1be7c67147f2d6e3cb11981dd99d01", "text": "Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\n\nThe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index.

Understanding gamma squeeze can give investors an edge.\n\nToday is quadruple witching. In quadruple witching, stock index futures, futures options, stock options, and single stock futures expire.

Bitcoin whales know that bitcoin is not an inflation hedge, so they took advantage of the strength to liquidate about $500M of bitcoin, causing bitcoin to drop. Bitcoin is trading around $68,000 as of this writing.\n\nProtection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.", "start_char_idx": 2914, "end_char_idx": 6214, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eceb6fb4-34fb-4243-bd4f-4354c11ac583": {"__data__": {"id_": "eceb6fb4-34fb-4243-bd4f-4354c11ac583", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/844.html", "file_name": "844.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6800, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2dbf37b5-9f68-4302-8be6-1cf38782317d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/844.html", "file_name": "844.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6800, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "29244d17e13beb8889728ac390efb3e65ba3ef040750aa535293a48ca2e4f49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a60629aa-645a-4637-a293-9172fb304dc2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/844.html", "file_name": "844.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6800, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "03d196fdf9f27cc77bfcc86fad21da0fd9fd025bc0bc64107fd369b05ccb2f13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b09ce2d-696b-4fb5-80fe-5e16994bdad2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "faa20622506b77317f7a818ed2f8765c0fe30f05b9008f5845dfc88c65ad426a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7496a3ff8631d10013680ec3558d43c9d491a3dbcd881ea8aa8158a55c62133d", "text": "When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.

Strong demand for the company\u2019s products has resulted in a major re-acceleration in growth.\n\nFor instance, last quarter, the company reported revenue of $3.66 billion, or up 100% compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $5.59. This represented around a 71.% year-over-year increase.\n\nThese strong results played a big role in sparking the SMCI stock rally, but it\u2019s been future forecasts that have really kicked it into overdrive.\n\nBased on sell-side forecasts, the analyst community expects more-than 100% revenue growth for the full fiscal year (ending June 2024), with EPS rising by around 90.6%, from $11.43 to $21.78 per share.\n\nAnalyst forecasts for next fiscal year vary, but the high end of these estimates call for further high revenue (73.2%) and EPS (73.7%) growth.\n\nThe Show Could Go On (Just Not Indefinitely)\n\nAdmittedly, even as Super Micro Computer could continue to post impressive levels of growth, one can look at the aforementioned big gains so far for SMCI stock, and argue that this upside is already priced into shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while the market may treat possibilities as near-certainties, not only may this be sustainable in the near-term. There may even be room for future potential to be baked into SMCI\u2019s share price.\n\nIf Super Micro once again reports \u2018beat and raise\u2019 results (like it did for last quarter) when it next releases fiscal results in April, this may fuel another spike for the stock. The \u201cAI boom\u201d has yet to turn into an \u201cAI bust.\u201d\n\nWith this, the market is likely to stay in a \u201cbuy on the rumor, buy more on the news\u201d type of mood.\n\nThat said, while there may be an opportunity to stay bullish on SMCI for now, be careful. It\u2019s too early to bet on a crash. It\u2019s not too late to hop in to ride the next wave. However, Super Micro could take a tumble down the road, when (not if) a slowdown, downturn, or full-on bust hits the AI space.\n\nStay Long for Now, But Pay Attention\n\nWhile many factors stand to keep SMCI trending higher, make no mistake. There are two risks that, if they emerge, could mean big trouble for the stock.\n\nFirst, if the tech sector\u2019s build-out of its AI infrastructure shows signs of slowing down, demand for Super Micro\u2019s products will undoubtedly slow down as well. The market loathes a growth slowdown; such an event would likely cause a sharp price decline for shares.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3348, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f86a57fa-1ab4-4013-8201-f43e6808541d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f86a57fa-1ab4-4013-8201-f43e6808541d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/846.html", "file_name": "846.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4389, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8eb9b803-bf57-4936-953c-885cd856ec9c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/846.html", "file_name": "846.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4389, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "bda771670fbbaca69c19e073ded06166169ab30a7c75eead3a50d0533ff07263", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b09ce2d-696b-4fb5-80fe-5e16994bdad2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/846.html", "file_name": "846.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4389, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "faa20622506b77317f7a818ed2f8765c0fe30f05b9008f5845dfc88c65ad426a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "746cdcb1-78dc-4413-b6b5-7f28899a5934", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1c978183c3848e6174e376cd50bf9f18074f18cc0505e5f534473b62fee2db5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cab80b5f28450b7d0ab6ba431a3e2744c01550f7b6311549341487d7e4fc67f0", "text": "It\u2019s too early to bet on a crash.

Anticipating that this momentum will continue, Mohan raised his price target on Dell stock Wednesday, to $130 a share -- implying an 18% upside.\n\nIs Dell stock a buy?\n\nDell is riding a tailwind from the AI revolution, and this is why Mohan believes the stock will continue to outperform the market. But could it be that $130 is too much to pay for a share of Dell stock over the next year?\n\nI think it might be.\n\nConsider that while Dell enjoyed strong profit growth last quarter, with EPS up nearly 90% year over year, consensus forecasts for the company's long-term prospects don't anticipate anything like that level of growth remaining sustainable. Over the next five years, for example, S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts Dell's per-share earnings might rise as high as $7.33 -- which would be only a 68% total increase, and closer to 11% per year, compounded.\n\nOrdinarily, for a stock growing at 11%, you'd want to pay no more than 11 times trailing earnings. But Dell stock trades at more than twice that -- 24x earnings.\n\nWhat's holding Dell back? You won't be surprised to learn that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could be the culprit. As Mohan observed, Dell has plenty of demand for its products, but its supply of Nvidia GPUs is limited. Simply put, Nvidia, which produces the H100 and H200 AI chips that Dell needs for its servers, has a chokehold on this market. This limits both how quickly Dell can grow server production to meet demand -- and lets Nvidia keep most of the profit for itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dell Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

Our fair value for the stock has been raised from $730 to $910.\n\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia\n\nNvidia Stock Valuation Update\n\nNvidia\u2019s NVDA GTC conference keynote address introduced the company\u2019s latest artificial intelligence graphics processor, or AI GPU, Blackwell, along with its associated platform and GPU clusters to enable AI workloads. Just as important, GTC showcased the efforts of the company\u2019s wide range of partners in areas such as robotics and automotive, among many others. We don\u2019t foresee these partners slowing their investments anytime soon, which supports our healthy growth estimates for Nvidia in the years ahead.\n\nWe raise our fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia to $910 per share from $730, as we\u2019ve taken a fresh look at our model assumptions and we\u2019re more optimistic about future industrywide capital expenditure, or capex, on AI GPUs in the decade ahead, both from large cloud computing vendors (that is, hyperscalers) and enterprises. Hyperscaler capex should be meaningfully higher in 2024, with Nvidia receiving a windfall from such spending, and we now anticipate even higher industrywide data center capex as more and more businesses invest in AI. We reiterate our Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as we concede that these capex plans, AI workloads, and competitive dynamics are changing rapidly. We now view Nvidia\u2019s shares as fairly valued.\n\nNvidia launched a barrage of news and partnerships at GTC \u2014 we count 42 press releases and/or blog posts on its website \u2014 but we think the larger trend is that a wide variety of businesses are reliant on Nvidia\u2019s AI GPU computing power, with Blackwell extending the company\u2019s lead. In turn, we think hyperscalers will continue to increase their total capex levels and disproportionately tilt their capex spending toward Nvidia\u2019s AI GPUs. These hyperscalers have the fortress balance sheets to support these investments in the years ahead and should reap the rewards of higher cloud computing revenue and earnings as these GPUs are deployed. We anticipate that enterprises will mirror higher capex as well.\n\nWhy Has Nvidia\u2019s Stock Risen so Much?\n\nLooking at cloud capex, we believe that much of the rise in Nvidia\u2019s share price in 2024 \u2014 up 77% year to date versus 7% for the Morningstar US Market Index\u2014and future earnings growth stems from hyperscaler and enterprise capex. These firms expect to spend incrementally more capex on AI GPUs in 2024, while also shifting the mix of \u201cmaintenance\u201d capex away from traditional networking and server gear toward AI GPUs. Nvidia has captured a much larger piece of the data center capex pie in recent quarters, and we anticipate that this mix shift will be the new normal for IT departments. Along these lines, we remain impressed with Nvidia\u2019s ability to elbow into additional hardware, software, and networking products and platforms.\n\nThat said, AMD recently lifted its total addressable market, or TAM, estimates for the AI accelerator market (including memory chips) in 2027 to $400 billion from $150 billion. While we\u2019re more optimistic about spending on AI accelerators in the years ahead, we still don\u2019t foresee Nvidia and its peers reaching this $400 billion threshold as soon as 2027. If AMD\u2019s forecast is accurate and Nvidia can retain its AI GPU market leadership, then our revenue assumptions for the company might turn out to be conservative.\n\nDespite our fair value estimate increase, we are keeping competitive pressures in mind.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3630, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22699f4d-3d90-429e-8156-5f5118c5a32e": {"__data__": {"id_": "22699f4d-3d90-429e-8156-5f5118c5a32e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/86.html", "file_name": "86.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6284, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e94a8fc9-9fc3-4900-9a8d-dade252d4fea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/86.html", "file_name": "86.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6284, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "a457ee7b88ec0ff9b6a7921f12062def78ec9a895dff15deffe8515a925cfc4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5678739-ab11-41db-a18c-a5c9f1aad602", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/86.html", "file_name": "86.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6284, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "d978b6076f93689269c7f85c53891911966c0490fc4f85990334a40947e6f172", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ea1b539-d170-43bd-931c-2a730096bdb7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e895412ad6b653e53e0af078ed95568c0a821cc243848611dce625b466ac4273", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9cba4499aa759fe6d8a0c0983095ca75794b8b52c0a428ba483dd8ac70111acd", "text": "Along these lines, we remain impressed with Nvidia\u2019s ability to elbow into additional hardware, software, and networking products and platforms.\n\nThat said, AMD recently lifted its total addressable market, or TAM, estimates for the AI accelerator market (including memory chips) in 2027 to $400 billion from $150 billion.

If AMD\u2019s forecast is accurate and Nvidia can retain its AI GPU market leadership, then our revenue assumptions for the company might turn out to be conservative.\n\nDespite our fair value estimate increase, we are keeping competitive pressures in mind. Nvidia\u2019s hefty operating margins are everyone else\u2019s opportunity, and every company in the AI ecosystem has incentive to be more efficient in AI spending and find alternative sources to Nvidia\u2014either in-house or among other vendors. Still, we think Nvidia will retain the bulk of the AI workload business\u2014certainly in AI training and perhaps a hefty piece of AI inference workloads, too.\n\nAmong the many announcements at GTC, we\u2019re particularly intrigued by the launch of Nvidia Inference Microservices. NIM tools are built on top of Nvidia\u2019s Cuda platform and will enable businesses to bring custom applications and pretrained AI models into production environments, which should aid these firms in bringing new AI products to market. We view Nvidia as dominant in AI training workloads, but we think that one of the highlights of the firm\u2019s blowout quarter in late February was its disclosure that 40% of its deployed GPUs are being used for AI inference. To the extent that Nvidia can emerge as the preferred industrywide solution for AI inference too, the company might be able to retain its dominant market share position (within an exponentially rising market) after all.\n\nNvidia\u2019s New Hardware\n\nOverall, Nvidia\u2019s hardware products announced at GTC appear impressive and will likely remain best-of-breed in the industry. Nvidia\u2019s latest GPU, Blackwell, is built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing on its 4NP process and includes a whopping 208 billion transistors and is double the size of its prior-generation Hopper H100 GPU. The Grace Blackwell Superchip, GB200, connects two B200 Blackwell GPUs with an Arm-based Grace CPU. We\u2019re still keeping an eye on Nvidia\u2019s attach rate with Grace, as it may allow Nvidia to capture an even greater piece of the GPU server pie away from x86 CPUs from Intel or AMD.\n\nOur new $910 fair value estimate implies a fiscal 2025 (ending January 2025, thus relating to 11 months of calendar 2024) price/adjusted earnings multiple of 35 times and a fiscal 2026 multiple of 26 times. Our fiscal 2025 revenue estimates of $116 billion in total and $101 billion in data center revenue for Nvidia are unchanged. However, we lifted our longer-term data center estimate for fiscal 2026 to $135 billion from $125 billion, and fiscal 2028 estimate to $184 billion from $141 billion, again driven by our revised estimates for a higher TAM based on greater industrywide data center capex spending. Our revised annual assumptions for fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027 revenue and adjusted EPS are above the mean FactSet consensus estimates before the event.", "start_char_idx": 2877, "end_char_idx": 6212, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ea1b539-d170-43bd-931c-2a730096bdb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ea1b539-d170-43bd-931c-2a730096bdb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/860.html", "file_name": "860.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9300, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7bdb2fd8-e411-48b0-bd9d-a83d7d68a7b0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/860.html", "file_name": "860.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9300, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "ed288b4f2b12b44930db299aeb9d72a36527171cd0c6290870577b359046c5c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22699f4d-3d90-429e-8156-5f5118c5a32e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/86.html", "file_name": "86.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 6284, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "9cba4499aa759fe6d8a0c0983095ca75794b8b52c0a428ba483dd8ac70111acd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5521d105-cd0f-42c0-9d8d-4beacf3f6d4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "76d20a1ab96071a1d91db03ecfe3cba8ce1714b980215418c3e340c6630756b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e895412ad6b653e53e0af078ed95568c0a821cc243848611dce625b466ac4273", "text": "Last week, two of the three widely followed indexes closed in the red, while one remained virtually unchanged.

Bitcoin recorded its all-time high at 72,841.37. The cryptocurrency market started 2024 on a positive note after an impressive rally last year.\n\nThe much-hyped reformation in the cryptocurrency space took place on Jan 10. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved rule changes to allow the creation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in January.\n\nAfter soaring 157% in 2023, Bitcoin has rallied more than 65% year to date. It continues to hold a lot of potential. The SEC's latest decision is likely to turn out to be a landmark, positioning the entire crypto space as an integral component of mainstream finance.\n\nThe game-changing decision of the SEC will allow individuals, money managers and other financial institutions to get exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nMoreover, the next Bitcoin halving will occur in April 2024. When this occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.\n\nOptimistic Estimates\n\nSeveral research firms have said that this is just the beginning of the Bitcoin rally. Standard Chartered expects Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. Research firm Fundstrat has provided a target range of $116,000 to $137,000 for this year. Hedge fund SkyBridge predicts $170,000 by April 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, VanEck estimated a medium-term target of $350,000 for Bitcoin. Connors's firm has estimated that in base-case, Bitcoin will reach $110,000 in 2024 and $140,000 the next year. However, according to the firm's best-case scenario, the cryptocurrency will hit $180,000 in 2024 and $450,000 in 2025.\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA's ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:\n\n69% = US$30b \u00f7 US$43b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.69.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 69% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that NVIDIA has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 39% net income growth seen by NVIDIA over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nWe then compared NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 29% in the same 5-year period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if NVIDIA is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs NVIDIA Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nNVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.2%, meaning that it has the remaining 95% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.\n\nBesides, NVIDIA has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 0.5% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that NVIDIA's future ROE will drop to 51% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that NVIDIA's performance has been quite good.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3719, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a40bc12-88b1-4892-aac9-3bf2d61ca796": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a40bc12-88b1-4892-aac9-3bf2d61ca796", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/89.html", "file_name": "89.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4926, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "edbd9a93-7b5b-43f8-848d-7fbea06f2888", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/89.html", "file_name": "89.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4926, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "02491139f6941411a8835972bc74caf8ef72af57a7f2366ac88d8a1273488cf7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf2f7a3e-76ee-4cfb-81ae-ce0806bd2ac5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/89.html", "file_name": "89.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4926, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "7bc7ef2b499101d83631cb03859ec867f4713aa582a272a979d972a17be0e6ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b74385a-9c29-4de0-b3dd-aecf651df104", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "251af99110fc3bb572993e515024391e57b44b0f517ab1654837fc9c4468ec8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "10bfee3901faddad6f885c8ae63108bbc401007bf91f6d181375643ff5689b37", "text": "This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.\n\nBesides, NVIDIA has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more.

Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.

This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.\n\nWe recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n\nThe SPY ETF SPY is currently hovering around the level of 511.69. For investors with a bullish outlook, the initial goal is to see the price move upwards to 512.26. If the momentum sustains and the price stays above 512.91, the next objective for buyers is to elevate the price to the support level of 513.76. Continuing with the bullish scenario for SPY, if the level of 513.76 remains robust during the normal trading hours, an upward movement towards 514.62 is anticipated. The ultimate bullish target for the day is set at 515.68, contingent on sustained buying interest.\n\nOn the flip side, if the SPY fails to maintain support at 511.69, the bearish scenario comes into play. The first lower target for bears is 510.95, where the market's resolve will be tested. A breach below this level could see the price descending to 510.14. Should the selling pressure intensify, the next critical support is at 509.49. In the event of a significant downturn, the bearish aim for the day is set at 508.83, marking the lowest expected point for SPY in this session.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series 1\n\nThe QQQ ETF QQQ, also known as 'The Q's', is currently trading near the pivotal point of 436.58. Bullish participants are looking for the price to surpass 437.47. Maintaining this level as support could lead to 438.89 being established as a firm support zone. If the buying force continues to dominate, the next level of interest is 440.00. An optimistic trading day for 'The Q's' might even push the price to test the 440.78 mark. The highest bullish target envisioned for today is 441.56.\n\nConversely, if 'The Q's' struggle to stay above 436.58 during the day's trading, bears might gain the upper hand. The initial downside target is set at 435.88, followed by a further drop to 434.76 if the weakness persists. A continued bearish trend could see the price testing the 433.64 support. Failing to hold this level might lead the bears towards their final target for the day at 432.84.\n\nApple Inc.\n\nApple's AAPL stock is currently positioned around 173.94. For a bullish outcome, the stock needs to maintain 174.59 as support. A successful hold could see a push towards 175.09. Sustained positive momentum might lift the price further to 175.81. If the bulls manage to keep control, the day could conclude with a rally towards the high bull target of 176.29 for Apple.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3072, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acd47318-17b5-44a3-bfe7-f56b3b899ef1": {"__data__": {"id_": "acd47318-17b5-44a3-bfe7-f56b3b899ef1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/92.html", "file_name": "92.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8789, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88a9e949-41a6-4b3a-b070-ccd6ca885ebf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/92.html", "file_name": "92.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8789, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "dc1960205bec438a8c042f14b945dbc24f5da9f1ac76a366d90eda162efd917e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b74385a-9c29-4de0-b3dd-aecf651df104", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/92.html", "file_name": "92.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8789, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "251af99110fc3bb572993e515024391e57b44b0f517ab1654837fc9c4468ec8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "694891c4-ed6c-4fa9-90f7-d019633040d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b31b17e8f8b3ae2e498ae01e9ee70dc30b7988b19415272be1a99d3cef6dd632", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5d9b4f6450a5743c101dd2a8c5af8a628fb03855de009e5ea9671bfd1baf7394", "text": "A continued bearish trend could see the price testing the 433.64 support.

For a bullish outcome, the stock needs to maintain 174.59 as support. A successful hold could see a push towards 175.09. Sustained positive momentum might lift the price further to 175.81. If the bulls manage to keep control, the day could conclude with a rally towards the high bull target of 176.29 for Apple.\n\nHowever, if Apple fails to keep 173.94 as support during the trading day, a downward adjustment is likely, starting with a test at 172.95. Continued selling could drive the price to 172.45. If the bearish pressure doesn't relent, the next level to watch is 171.79. A breach here could lead to the bears aiming for their day's low target at 171.13 for Apple.\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nMicrosoft Corp.\n\nMicrosoft MSFT is navigating the market at around 416.32. For the bulls, it's crucial for the price to remain stable above this level and aim for a climb to 419.17, which should be secured as support. A sustained position above this mark could prompt a rally towards 421.62. If the bullish momentum is maintained, Microsoft's stock might reach the day's high bull target of 422.84.\n\nOn the contrary, if Microsoft can't hold the 416.32 level, the bears might look to lower the price to 414.56 as their first target. A break below this level would set the stage for further bearish tests at 413.14. Persistent downward pressure could eventually push the stock to 411.72, with the ultimate bear target for the day being 410.64.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\nNVIDIA's NVDA stock is currently trading near 877.25. Bulls are aiming for a push towards 882.97 to establish it as a solid support level. A successful claim of this level could lead to further bullish advances to 890.55. With continued buying activity, NVIDIA could see a rally towards 898.13, with the day's high bull target set at 903.25.\n\nConversely, if NVIDIA fails to maintain 877.25 as a support level today, the bears will look to lower the price to 865.62. Should the selling pressure increase and break this level, the next target for bears is 858.43. A weaker market sentiment could lead to a test at 852.61, with the ultimate bear target for the day being 846.80.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A\n\nAlphabet's GOOGL stock is trading around 146.89. The bulls are looking to hold this level as support and push the price higher to 147.68. A continuation of the bullish trend could lead to a test of the high bull target at 148.95.\n\nIf Alphabet fails to maintain 146.89 as support during the trading hours, the bears might aim to decrease the price to 145.94. A breakdown below this level could lead to further bearish targets at 144.72. In the case of significant selling activity, the price might be driven down to the day's low bear target for Alphabet at 143.77.", "start_char_idx": 2518, "end_char_idx": 5482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "694891c4-ed6c-4fa9-90f7-d019633040d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "694891c4-ed6c-4fa9-90f7-d019633040d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/92.html", "file_name": "92.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8789, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88a9e949-41a6-4b3a-b070-ccd6ca885ebf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/92.html", "file_name": "92.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8789, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "dc1960205bec438a8c042f14b945dbc24f5da9f1ac76a366d90eda162efd917e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "acd47318-17b5-44a3-bfe7-f56b3b899ef1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/92.html", "file_name": "92.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 8789, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "5d9b4f6450a5743c101dd2a8c5af8a628fb03855de009e5ea9671bfd1baf7394", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b35ac878-d770-4ed6-b683-1cc1f8947c71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6093cba90029332bab5a31136b4b86a9f28b144cafcfcb55fd081bec48e6bc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b31b17e8f8b3ae2e498ae01e9ee70dc30b7988b19415272be1a99d3cef6dd632", "text": "Alphabet Inc Class A\n\nAlphabet's GOOGL stock is trading around 146.89.

In the case of significant selling activity, the price might be driven down to the day's low bear target for Alphabet at 143.77.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc\n\nMeta's META stock is orbiting around the level of 492.33. Bulls are keen on maintaining strength above 495.54, which should act as support, with an eye on moving higher to 498.03. A robust buying session could elevate the price to 500.83. With continued bullish sentiment, Meta's price could approach the high bull target of 504.54 for the day.\n\nHowever, if Meta can't sustain the 492.33 level as support, the bears might take control, starting with a move to 488.81. Persistent bearish pressure could see a further decline to 485.96. If the selling continues, the next target is 483.11, marking the bear's low target for the day.\n\nTesla Inc.\n\nTesla TSLA is currently trading near the crucial level of 172.61. Bulls are looking to drive the price up to 176.34. If buying continues, the next target is the key level of 179.79. A bullish market environment might propel Tesla to test higher at 182.53. If the buying sentiment is strong, the day might end with Tesla reaching the high bull target of 184.10.\n\nHowever, if Tesla fails to hold 172.61 as a strong support level today, a downward move to 169.70 is anticipated. Continued selling could lead to a further drop to 166.89. If this level is compromised, the bears will aim for the day's low bear target at 164.87.\n\nFinal Word: In today's trading session, attention is drawn to the release of Housing Starts and Building Permits data for February in the US at 8:30 AM EST, along with the release of the Canadian CPI for the same month. The afternoon will feature a 20-Year Bond Auction by the Treasury at 1 PM EST, expected to introduce significant volatility. Market participants are likely to position themselves strategically in anticipation of the FOMC rate decision tomorrow. It's crucial to monitor volume closely and trade with caution.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16.4% over the past month to $23.22.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $11.93, the critical question arises: is NVIDIA significantly overvalued? This article aims to explore NVIDIA's current valuation and provide a detailed analysis to answer this pressing question for investors.\n\nCompany Introduction\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NVDA, Financial) is a leading developer of graphics processing units, traditionally used to enhance computing experiences, particularly in PC gaming. The company has evolved, with GPUs now pivotal in artificial intelligence applications. NVIDIA offers not only AI GPUs but also a software platform, Cuda, for AI model development and training. Expanding into data center networking solutions, NVIDIA is further solidifying its role in managing complex workloads. With a current stock price of $913.22 and a market cap of $2.30 trillion, a comparison to the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is essential to gauge whether NVIDIA's stock is correctly valued.\n\nSummarize GF Value\n\nThe GF Value is a proprietary measure reflecting the intrinsic value of a stock. It incorporates historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line suggests the stock's fair trading value. If NVIDIA's stock price is significantly above this line, it is considered overvalued, which may lead to poor future returns. Conversely, a price well below the GF Value Line could indicate higher future returns.\n\nAt the moment, NVIDIA (NVDA, Financial) appears to be significantly overvalued, with a GF Value of $679.99, suggesting that its long-term stock return could be lower than its future business growth projections.\n\nLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.\n\nFinancial Strength\n\nWhen assessing potential investments, the financial strength of a company is paramount to avoid the high risk of permanent capital loss. NVIDIA's cash-to-debt ratio of 2.35 ranks better than 55.26% of its industry peers, indicating a strong financial position. With an overall financial strength rating of 9 out of 10, NVIDIA stands out as a robust contender in the semiconductor sector.\n\nProfitability and Growth\n\nInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with a history of consistent profitability, is generally less risky. NVIDIA boasts a decade of profitability, with a staggering operating margin of 54.12%, ranking higher than 99.39% of its industry competitors. The company's profitability rank of 10 out of 10 underscores its strong performance.\n\nGrowth is a crucial valuation factor, often correlating with long-term stock performance. NVIDIA's 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of 54.3% surpasses 94.49% of the industry, while its EBITDA growth rate of 84.6% outperforms 94.79% of semiconductor companies, reflecting its exceptional value creation for shareholders.\n\nROIC vs WACC\n\nComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) with its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another way to gauge profitability. NVIDIA's ROIC of 103.79 significantly exceeds its WACC of 18.26, indicating the company's efficiency in generating cash flow relative to the capital invested, thus creating shareholder value.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, despite NVIDIA's strong financial condition, profitability, and growth, the stock appears to be significantly overvalued. For investors considering NVIDIA, it is crucial to weigh these factors against the company's current market valuation.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3618, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "595bb2ea-da19-44b4-aed0-091800b4bc66": {"__data__": {"id_": "595bb2ea-da19-44b4-aed0-091800b4bc66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "files/94.html", "file_name": "94.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4552, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "60bb9db8-a2b7-443f-b664-97deacdfb25d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/94.html", "file_name": "94.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4552, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "b3dd612bd9f2f521765e964a1e9c30317877f6cf1106d1dd0721b4841c7fe88d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd88b244-9973-4bbb-a2e3-7b7a4477984a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "files/94.html", "file_name": "94.html", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4552, "creation_date": "2024-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-20"}, "hash": "f80dc2c36966f2376a692adb73d303cfbc6a76eec0f40fb97b24943cd57b9763", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "542e442c-6ce6-4916-8ee9-ffc9e07ce2d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01cd31c019b6a8abdd6ba1c170e34847f0e2c1f87dd484882fd2bad0d4a7dac9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "81cefa37a176eded4a28bcbea2ae8bd76058bc5184ead5611efc3577d1fc4343", "text": "ROIC vs WACC\n\nComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) with its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another way to gauge profitability.
